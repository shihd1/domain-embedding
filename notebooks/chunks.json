        "Part 02": "Bill Forsthoffer began his lifetime career in rotating machinery in 1962 with De Laval Turbine Inc., where he worked part-time in various departments before joining the Compressor Engineering Department full-time in 1968. His responsibilities included centrifugal compressor component and auxiliary design, along with field engineering assistance for start-up and problem resolution. In 1974, Bill transitioned to Mobil Oil Corporate Engineering, overseeing all aspects of rotating equipment from specification to troubleshooting. After 15 years at Mobil, he founded his own consulting company in 1990, providing services to over 100 companies in project reliability assurance, training, and troubleshooting.\n\nAs President of Forsthoffer Associates Inc., Bill is actively involved in the industry, contributing articles to Turbo Machinery International Magazine and conducting workshops. The comprehensive training provided by Bill has reached over 7,000 individuals, emphasizing the reliability of rotating equipment and the operational intricacies associated with it.\n\nThroughout his career, Bill has been supported by a network of dedicated individuals, including mentors, business associates, and friends, who have played crucial roles in his professional development.

        "Part 03": "The function of each individual classification of rotating equipment will be to observe the similarities in both Principles of Rotating Equipment performance and mechanical aspects of various types of equipment. Regardless of the type of equipment considered, it will be seen that many relationships apply. Each unit of rotating equipment, consisting of a driven machine, driver, and supported by auxiliary equipment, is essentially a system. Rotating equipment moves products, which can be solids, liquids, or gases. Different classifications of rotating equipment exist, all serving the purpose of moving money. A successful recommendation to management must address the problems' cost to the company, the recommended solution, and proof that the solution will work, along with the savings it will bring. Management support is crucial for implementing any action plan based on what is learned. Four basic function classifications of rotating equipment include drivers or prime movers which provide power, transmission devices, and auxiliary equipment. Examples of rotating equipment types grouped according to function are provided.\n\nIn this book, the study begins by focusing on the similarities in equipment before delving into specific differences. Pumps and compressors, for example, are both driven types of equipment that move products. Despite handling different fluids (liquids for pumps and gases for compressors), their functions remain identical. Mechanical components such as bearings perform the same function regardless of the equipment they are in. Performance and mechanical functions are similar regardless of equipment type. Proceeding through the book, it will be discovered that positive displacement or dynamic performance principles remain consistent regardless of the equipment type."

        "Part 04": "Rotating Equipment Overview: \nComparing Dynamic Pump and Compressor Performance\nBoth pumps and compressors play a crucial role in moving fluids through energy levels. While pumps handle incompressible fluids like liquids, compressors deal with compressible fluids such as gases. Despite the difference in fluid characteristics, the fundamental principles of dynamic machines apply to both types of equipment. The volume flow rate and gas velocity in passages are influenced by the compressibility of gases. Mechanical components, including bearings, internal seals, and shaft end seals, perform similar functions across different equipment types and classifications. These mechanical and performance similarities underline the importance of understanding the common principles across rotating equipment.\n\nClassifications of Rotating Equipment:\nPositive displacement and performance design, as well as mechanical design, are key factors in classifying rotating equipment. Throughout this exploratory journey, we will unravel how these principles remain consistent irrespective of the specific type of equipment, whether it is a pump, compressor, or turbine. The mechanical integrity of bearings, seals, and other components remains crucial regardless of the role they play in specific equipment types. Understanding these classifications is essential for effective condition monitoring to enhance site safety and reliability.\n\nThe Equipment 'Train' or 'Unit':\nIn every pump unit or compressor train, one can observe the presence of all four classifications of equipment. Be it the driven components, drivers, transmission systems, or auxiliary systems, these elements are indispensable for the functioning of rotating equipment. Successfully troubleshooting or designing equipment requires recognizing the interplay between these classifications within a unit or train, ensuring comprehensive assessment and problem-solving capacities.\n\nImportant Fundamentals:\nThe environment in which rotating equipment operates significantly impacts its reliability and availability. Factors such as process conditions, piping, foundation design, and ambient conditions play a pivotal role in determining the overall effectiveness and lifespan of the equipment. Proper consideration of these environmental aspects during the design and specification phases is crucial for minimizing downtime, maintenance costs, and ensuring optimal operational performance.\n\nLife Span of Rotating Equipment:\nThe longevity of rotating equipment juxtaposed against the relatively short phases of specification, design, and installation highlights the critical importance of getting these initial phases right. Improper specifications, design flaws, or installation errors can have long-lasting repercussions on maintenance requirements, costs, and the overall availability of the machinery. Understanding the life cycle of rotating equipment is essential for effective preventive and predictive maintenance strategies to maximize operational efficiency and minimize disruptions.\n\nEnd User Objectives:\nTo achieve maximum reliability, product throughput, and operational cost-efficiency, end users must actively engage in the project from the specification and design stages onwards. The collaborative effort between end users and project stakeholders during these initial phases is essential for meeting objectives and ensuring long-term profitability. Effective field maintenance starts at the project specification phase, where inadequate parameters can directly impact equipment availability and performance.\n\nDefinitions of Reliability and Availability:\nReliability and availability are pivotal metrics in assessing the operational efficiency and sustainability of rotating equipment. Properly defining and understanding these terms is essential for implementing robust maintenance strategies and optimizing machinery performance over its lifespan. The end user's proactive involvement in project phases, from specification through installation, is key to achieving the desired objectives of reliability, productivity, and cost-effectiveness."

    {
        "Part 05": "The life span of rotating equipment is significantly longer compared to the specification, design, and installation phases, which only represent about 10% of the total operational life of the process unit. Any shortcomings in the specification, design, or installation stages greatly impact the maintenance needs, costs, and availability of the machinery. For optimal performance, the end user must prioritize maximum reliability, product throughput, and cost efficiency. Involvement in the project early on, during specification and design, is crucial for effective field maintenance and equipment availability.\n\nReliability and availability are key metrics in equipment operation. Reliability, measured in operating hours per year, does not account for planned downtime, while availability, considering planned stoppages like turnarounds, is essential and should exceed 95%. Proper specification directly influences availability, impacting product revenue which can incur substantial losses, especially in critical equipment shutdown scenarios. Upset conditions in rotating equipment can lead to rapid deterioration, underscoring the importance of maintaining a thin lubrication film for continuous operation.\n\nUnderstanding the demands placed on rotating equipment, such as turbo-compressors, exemplifies the intricacies involved — for instance, a turbo-compressor running at 6,000 RPM performs an astounding number of revolutions annually, emphasizing the need for precise maintenance. The considerations of positive displacement and dynamic compression in compressors mirror those in pumps, with positive displacement compressors enhancing gas pressure by operating on fixed volumes, encompassing various types like reciprocating and rotary compressors. The distinct characteristics of fixed volume, variable pressure capability, and non-self-limiting operation define positive displacement compressors, necessitating pressure or power limiting mechanisms to prevent stalling or damage."

    {
        "Part 06": "Positive displacement compressors, along with their characteristics of fixed volume and variable pressure capability, are crucial in the realm of compression systems. These compressors operate on a set volume within a confined space to elevate gas pressure. Various types exist, including reciprocating, rotary liquid piston, rotary lobe, and screw compressors. Imagine the functioning of a positive displacement reciprocating compressor resembling a syringe—the gas enters only after the suction pressure is lowered, and exits when the cylinder pressure surpasses the discharge pressure. This type of compressor necessitates a power or pressure limiting mechanism, such as a relief valve, to prevent stalling or damage.\n\nMoving forward, the discussion shifts to actual flow, mass flow, and standard flow in compressor design. Actual volume flow is pivotal, as it determines optimal gas velocity and subsequent compression outcomes. The comparison between actual and standard volumes, with the standard being fixed at specific pressure and temperature conditions, highlights the importance of these flow measures for accurate power calculations and customer billing processes.\n\nTransitioning to dynamic compressors, these systems utilize rotating blades to elevate gas pressure through increased gas velocity. Types like axial and centrifugal compressors are notable examples. In contrast to positive displacement compressors, dynamic compressors operate on variable capacity, fixed energy, and are self-limiting. Understanding the velocities at the exit of the moving blade, including tip speed and relative velocity, is essential for comprehending the performance variances between dynamic and positive displacement compressors. Ultimately, the operational characteristics of these compressors, guided by their unique curves and limitations, play a critical role in determining efficient system performance and optimal operating points."

        "Part 07": "Standard cubic feet is the ratio of the actual pressure referenced standard temperature to the actual temperature multiplied by the actual volume. In a compressor with a compression ratio of two and no compression temperature increase, the standard cubic feet per minute remains unchanged assuming a dry gas. This consistency is maintained since the discharge standard volume is the ratio of the discharge pressure to the standard atmospheric pressure multiplied by the discharge volume, resulting in the same exit standard volume as the inlet. Mass flow is determined by the product of the actual volume flow and the density of the specific gas. Both standard volume flow and mass flow play essential roles in describing process capacities and are utilized in power calculations. Moreover, the utilization of standard volume or weight measures is crucial for billing customers for produced gas products.\n\nDynamic compressors increase gas pressure through the use of rotating blades to elevate gas velocity. These compressors, including axial and centrifugal types, rely on two key velocities at the exit of the moving blade: tip speed, which is the product of blade tip diameter and RPM, and relative velocity, which is the gas velocity between two blades. Centrifugal compressors exhibit a distinct curve from positive displacement compressors, offering variable capacity and fixed energy or head for a given flow, ultimately being self-limiting due to maximum pressure and horsepower constraints.\n\nObservations on dynamic compressor curves illustrate that higher energy or head can only be developed at lower flows for a given speed. The operating point of a system in combination with the compressor operating curve determines the compressor's performance characteristics. Additionally, the concept of an equivalent orifice simplifies the representation of axial compressor blade rows or radial compressor impellers for analysis. Positive displacement compressors, on the other hand, boast fixed flow and variable head characteristics, making them non-self-limiting and potentially necessitating relieving devices for pressure control.\n\nThe principles behind positive displacement compressors, including reciprocating and rotary variants, involve increasing gas pressure by operating on a fixed volume within a confined space. Each compressor's design emphasizes volume flow, with actual flow being the key consideration due to its correlation with gas velocity. Standard volume and mass flow are essential descriptors of process conditions, remaining constant if condensate formation within a compressor section is avoided. The interactions between standard volume and mass flow are crucial for power calculations and process capability descriptions.\n"

        "Part 08": "The internal construction of a typical reciprocating compressor cylinder is shown in Figure 2.3. As the piston moves from left to right, a constant volume of gas will be displaced. The discharge pressure developed will be the pressure at the discharge flange caused by the process pressure and system resistance. Every compressor is designed on the principle of volume flow where actual flow is used for design considerations. Standard volume and mass flow are utilized to describe process conditions when no condensate is formed within the compressor section. \n\nOne standard cubic foot or one normal cubic meter equals standard cubic feet per minute or normal cubic meters per hour. Mass flow is calculated by multiplying actual flow by pressure, describing process capabilities and used for power calculations. \n\nIn illustrating the characteristics of a positive displacement compressor, pressures related to a simple process system are outlined, with pressure indicators providing key information. Additionally, by plotting various parameters such as air flow and brake horsepower, the performance characteristics of a positive compressor can be defined. \n\nFor rotating equipment, the relationship between head and pressure ratio is emphasized. Not being self-limiting signifies that pressure ratio and horsepower will continue increasing until certain thresholds are met, necessitating pressure relief valves in systems with positive displacement compressors. \n\nDynamic compressors operate by increasing gas pressure through rotating blades to elevate gas velocity, as shown in the assembly drawings and performance curves presented. The contrast between axial and centrifugal compressors regarding pressure rise and functionality is underscored, with centrifugal compressors showcasing differences in velocity and energy input based on the relative gas velocity in impeller blades."

    {
        "Part 09": "A dynamic compressor, as explained in the text, increases gas pressure by utilizing rotating blades to boost gas velocity. This method differs from positive displacement compressors. The dynamics of a dynamic compressor's operation appear more intricate than that of positive displacement compressors. The performance of dynamic compressors is influenced by factors such as velocity vectors, relative gas velocity in impeller or blade rows, and optimizing flow areas for enhanced impeller efficiencies. The characteristics of dynamic compressors, including their performance curves, show differences compared to positive displacement compressors. For instance, dynamic compressors feature varying volume delivery and fixed head capacity. In contrast, positive displacement compressors have constant volume flow. The performance curves of these two types of compressors are distinct, with dynamic compressors typically handling higher inlet flow rates. Additionally, dynamic compressors exhibit self-limiting behavior, eliminating the need for a relief valve for protection, unlike positive displacement compressors. Figures within the text demonstrate the performance characteristics and pressure ratios of both compression types, highlighting their operational variances."

        "Part 10": "In this chapter, we delve into the operation of compressors within a process system context. A system, comprising interconnected components such as vessels, exchangers, control valves, and piping, collectively generates a resistance to flow at the turbo-compressor flanges. Within this system, two crucial elements come into play: the suction system and the discharge system.\n\nThe primary goal of a compressor in a system is twofold: to maintain a balance where the flow exiting the suction vessel matches the incoming flow rate while concurrently reducing pressure from the suction vessel to the compressor flanges. On the discharge end, the aim is to propel the necessary flow through the resistance of the system to achieve the ultimate terminal pressure in the discharge system.\n\nThe accumulation of system resistance, from the terminal point back to the compressor discharge flange, signifies the energy needed by the compressor. It's imperative to note that increasing either the discharge or suction system resistance will augment the required compressor energy. Notably, a positive displacement compressor, through confining gas in a specific space, consistently boosts energy, demonstrating insensitivity to gas composition alterations or system adjustments. Conversely, a dynamic compressor, which augments gas energy by acting on it with blades, displays heightened sensitivity to changes in gas composition and system resistance, influencing its operating point significantly.\n\nThe equilibrium between the net process system energy demand and the compressor characteristic establishes the compressor operating point, showcasing a stable flow for a positive displacement compressor regardless of system alterations, while dynamic compressors exhibit significant flow variations in response to system resistance changes. System resistance characteristics can also evolve, influenced by factors like terminal pressure and resistance alterations with flow modifications. Ultimately, a harmonized dynamic compressor curve and system resistance curve can result in a synergistic operational dynamic within the system."
    },
    {
        "Part 11": "A positive displacement compressor operates consistently regardless of changes in gas composition or system resistance, maintaining a relatively constant delivered volume flow. In contrast, a dynamic compressor, which enhances gas energy through blade action, is highly sensitive to gas composition variations that affect mass and velocity within the impellers. Additionally, dynamic compressors are responsive to alterations in system resistance, adjusting volume throughput as required. The interaction between a compressor and system resistance curves determines the operating point, with the potential for instability when both curves are flat. Understanding the system resistance curve's characteristics, influenced by factors like terminal pressure and resistance components, is crucial for stability. Different process systems exhibit varying system resistance curves, with a recycle loop displaying the most stable operation. Compressor acceptability can be influenced by the system type, with certain compressors deemed suitable based on the process system's head characteristic curve. Operating points are critical equilibrium conditions determined by the interaction of compressor and system resistance curves, with industry standards mandating a guaranteed operating point but not necessarily a fixed compressor curve shape."
    },
    {
        "Part 12": "The system resistance curves in Figures 3.4 and 3.5 provide valuable insights into the operation of compressors within different process systems. Understanding these curves is crucial for ensuring stable operation. For instance, the curve starting at a zero pressure differential indicates a system with only system resistance, typical of a recycle process. In contrast, the curve starting at around 50 PSI showcases a system where both vessel pressure and resistance are present.\n\nMoreover, Figure 3.5 illustrates the system resistance characteristics for different types of process systems. Notably, the steepest curve, the recycle loop, offers the most stable operation, irrespective of the compressor curve shape. This stability is essential, especially when the compressor's head curve is relatively flat, as seen in certain cases where compressor acceptability is questioned based on the system type.\n\nThe selected compressor curve, as depicted in Figure 3.6, is crucial for determining the operating point, which signifies the balance between the equipment's head production and the process system's head requirements. This equilibrium point, as shown in Figure 3.7, can shift based on changes in both the turbo-compressor and system resistance curves.\n\nIn scenarios where process conditions are accurately specified and equipment is suitably chosen, the operating point aligns with the best efficiency point, as detailed in Figure 3.8. However, deviations from this point can result in efficiency and flow rate reductions. Understanding these dynamics is vital when incorporating positive displacement or dynamic compressors into the process system, as highlighted in Figures 3.9 and 3.10.\n\nBy grasping the implications of system resistance and gas density on compressor performance, engineers can make informed decisions regarding the selection and operation of compressors within varied process systems."

        "Part 13": "A pump is defined as a device that moves a liquid by increasing the energy level of the liquid. There are various types of pumps, including positive displacement pumps and dynamic pumps. Positive displacement pumps operate by displacing a fixed volume in a confined area, such as those utilizing rotary blades like screw, gear, and reciprocating pumps. They provide constant volume delivery, variable differential head, and are relatively insensitive to liquid properties. On the other hand, dynamic pumps, like centrifugal and axial pumps, generate pressure by using rotating impellers and are sensitive to changes in the system and liquid properties.\n\nRegardless of whether using positive displacement or dynamic pumps, each pump consists of hydraulic and mechanical components. The hydraulic end involves moving the liquid, while the mechanical end includes components like shafts, bearings, seals, couplings, and casings. The performance relationships of head, horsepower, and efficiency remain the same for all pumps. These relationships are identical across pump types; the efficiency may vary, but the mechanical components function similarly.\n\nPositive displacement pumps maintain a constant flow with variable head capacity. For instance, a double-acting piston pump operates by increasing liquid pressure as the piston moves, displacing the liquid irrespective of its specific gravity or viscosity, given sufficient power from the pump driver. In petrochemical plants, refineries, and gas plants, positive displacement pumps like plunger, piston, and reciprocating pumps are commonly found for various applications within specified horsepower limits.\n\nReciprocating pumps, a subset of positive displacement pumps, increase liquid energy through a pulsating action. They include power pumps, direct acting steam pumps, diaphragm pumps, and metering pumps. Pulsations produced by reciprocating pumps can potentially damage the pumps or process system if not properly managed. Anti-pulsation devices are often required to mitigate these pulsations, ensuring efficient and safe operation."

        "Part 14": "Positive displacement pumps increase liquid energy through a pulsating action. These pumps include power pumps, direct-acting steam pumps, diaphragm pumps, and metering pumps. Their pulsations can potentially harm the pumps or process systems if not properly analyzed and designed. Anti-pulsation devices like volume bottles, orifices, or pulsation bottles are often necessary.\n\nPower pumps, depicted in Figure 4.6, are mainly used for high-pressure, low-flow applications such as carbonate or amine services. They can operate horizontally or vertically and consist of a liquid cylinder with pistons and rods, as well as valves and a power end. The power end comprises a crankshaft with bearings, connecting rod, and crosshead assembly. Requiring an external power source like an electric motor or internal combustion engine, these pumps are known as \"Tower Pump,\" distinguishing them from direct-acting pumps utilizing steam cylinders.\n\nDiaphragm pumps, illustrated in Figure 4.7, demonstrate comparable power and liquid end sizes, allowing them to pump against pressures equivalent to the motive fluid's pressure. While diaphragm pumps are limited in the refining and petrochemical industry, they are mainly used for metering services. Additionally, metering pumps are prevalent for chemical injection service, ensuring precise control over chemical amounts in process streams by adjusting the stroke length. \n\nRotary pumps, which do not cause pulsations, are notably efficient and versatile, making them suitable for lube oil, seal oil, and other high-viscosity oil services. Their capacities range from fractions of a gallon to over 5,000 gallons per minute, with pressure capabilities up to 5,000 PSI. These pumps are compatible with liquids ranging from less than one centistoke to over 1,000,000 centistokes in viscosity, shown in Figure 4.9's screw pump design.\n\nGear pumps, another common type, work by carrying fluid between the teeth of two external gears, displacing it as the gears mesh. These pumps are ideal for small-volume lube oil services and highly viscous liquids such as asphalt and polyethylene, as depicted in Figure 4.10. \n\nCentrifugal pumps, referred to as \"dynamic\" machines, utilize centrifugal force to move liquids from lower to higher pressure levels. Liquid enters the impeller's center, receiving energy which is then discharged through a volute, as demonstrated in Figure 4.11. Widely used in the petrochemical and refining industry, centrifugal pumps come in various designs, detailed in Table 4.2."

These pumps, including screw and gear types, are ideal for lube oil and high viscosity oil applications, with capacities ranging from small volumes to over 5,000 gallons per minute at pressures up to 5,000 PSI.\n\nThe screw pump design displaces a fixed volume of fluid per revolution by carrying fluid axially between closely spaced rotors. Similarly, gear pumps operate by carrying fluid between the teeth of external gears. Centrifugal pumps, referred to as dynamic machines, leverage centrifugal force to move liquids from lower to higher pressures. They are widely used in the refining and petrochemical industry due to their efficiency.\n\nVarious types of centrifugal pumps are employed in different applications, such as single stage overhung pumps, single stage inline pumps, and integral gear centrifugal pumps. The single stage overhung pump design, popular in the industry, features an impeller attached to a shaft. The single stage inline pump can be vertically mounted between pipe flanges without needing a baseplate, although a support plate is recommended. The integral gear centrifugal pump is suitable for low-flow, high-head applications.\n\nOther pump designs include single stage double flow between bearing, multistage horizontal split, multistage barrel, and vertical canned pumps. These designs cater to specific service conditions, exceeding the capabilities of standard pumps, such as high temperatures and working pressures. Vertical canned pumps are particularly useful in situations with low available NPSH, featuring a can-type design. Lubrication for sleeve bearings is provided by liquid, with sealing typically accomplished using a mechanical seal."

A thrust balance device is necessary for the barrel casing design since the impeller configuration is predominantly 'inline '. The circular mounted end flange ensures a tight joint with excellent repeatability compared to horizontal split case designs.\n\nVertical canned pumps offer various types and designs, often used due to low available NPSH. The can-type design widely utilized in the Petrochemical industry, particularly for pumping low specific atmospheric principle materials. Lubrication of sleeve bearings is achieved through liquid, with sealing typically done using a mechanical seal.\n\nThe sump pump design is popular for managing run-off streams of rainwater and handling non-corrosive or corrosive liquids. Submersible pumps, designed to be submerged in the pumped fluid, are increasingly used in the refining and petrochemical industry due to environmental restrictions.\n\nMagnetic drive pumps, like the MDP, have become prominent in response to stringent environmental regulations. This design features a motor shaft attached to the power frame by a flexible or rigid coupling, with alignment requirements similar to horizontally mounted centrifugal pumps with mechanical seals or packing. Sealless pumps are favored for containing toxic or hazardous fluids.\n\nSelecting between positive displacement and centrifugal pumps requires consideration of hydraulic conditions and the nature of the fluid being handled.

Centrifugal pumps accommodate liquid viscosities up to 3,000 SSU, while rotary pumps handle materials ranging from 60 SSU to high viscosities. \n\nEach pump type, positive displacement (PD) and centrifugal, carries its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Centrifugal pumps offer variable capacity control, can handle catalyst-containing liquids, and have lower costs compared to PD pumps with similar hydraulic conditions. They operate with liberal clearances, minimal wear, and don't usually need overpressure protection. \n\nOn the other hand, PD pumps are not limited by delivery pressure, suitable for high viscosity liquids, and exhibit higher efficiencies compared to centrifugal pumps. They are less affected by specific gravity and provide a consistent flow rate. However, they require priming, develop limited head over constant speed operations, and produce pulsations in reciprocating models.\n\nKeeping track of the pump curves is crucial. The centrifugal pump curve showcases the increase in head as flow rate rises. This curve defines the pump's performance over its lifespan, showing the energy produced for specific design and operating conditions. It's essential for the pump's energy output to exceed the system's energy requirements to move liquid effectively.\n\nFor PD pumps, the positive displacement curve illustrates performance characteristics, where differential pressure is plotted against flow rate. Unlike centrifugal pumps, the differential pressure in PD pumps remains constant regardless of specific gravity. Pump efficiencies for different PD pump types range between 70% to 85%.\n\nTo prevent vaporization in reciprocating PD pumps due to pulsating flow, system design should consider acceleration energy, termed as \"acceleration head loss.\" Calculations for Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH) are crucial for ensuring the liquid enters the pump without issues. \n\nUnderstanding the performance curves for both centrifugal and PD pumps is necessary for their successful application in various systems, considering factors such as flow rates, pressure requirements, and energy efficiencies.\n"

The pump's performance is typically characterized by differential pressure plotted against flow rather than head, showcasing the energy generated by the pump. Unlike centrifugal pumps, the head produced by positive displacement pumps remains constant regardless of specific gravity, making the differential pressure a suitable indicator of energy produced.\n\nEfficiencies of positive displacement pumps are quantified in terms of volumetric efficiency, with variations based on pump type. Rotary pumps exhibit efficiencies ranging from 70% to 80%, while plunger and reciprocating pumps range from 75% to 85%.

Calculation of Net Positive Suction Head Available (NPSHA) accounts for the impact of pulsating flow characteristics on pump performance. Centrifugal pumps, on the other hand, operate within defined performance curves influenced by impeller geometry and flow rates. Multistaging with multiple impellers can be employed to meet system energy requirements beyond the capacity of a single-stage centrifugal pump.\n\nThe operation of a centrifugal pump entails a balance between flow rate and energy requirements, with oversizing leading to potential issues at both low and high flow ends of the performance curve. Low flow operation can result in flow recirculation and turbulence, while high flow conditions may cause mechanical damage due to excessive power consumption and potential choke flow. Maintaining optimal pump efficiency at the Best Efficiency Point (B.E.P.) is essential for minimizing losses and ensuring reliable operation."

        "Part 19": "Horsepower on a typical centrifugal pump curve is affected by the specific gravity of the pumped liquid. For liquids with a specific gravity other than water (S.G. = 1.0), the horsepower indicated on the pump curve needs to be adjusted by the actual specific gravity of the liquid. The net positive suction head required by a centrifugal pump changes approximately with the square of the flow rate, reflecting the pressure drop from the pump suction flange to the eye of the first stage. NPSH Required is also impacted by the pump's rotational speed, exhibiting a slightly less than squared relationship with the speed. \n\nThe centrifugal pump curve is bounded by high and low flow limits that can potentially harm the pump if exceeded. Operating at low flow rates can lead to flow recirculation that damages the pump's components. Oversizing a centrifugal pump can lead to low flows through the impeller, causing flow reversal and turbulence, potentially resulting in cavitation at the back side of the impeller vane. This oversizing can adversely affect performance and mechanical reliability, causing issues such as internal recirculation damage to the impeller, operation away from the best efficiency point, high radial loads, bearing and seal failures, elevated internal temperatures, and the need for minimum flow bypass.\n\nConversely, selecting a pump that operates at high flow rates, far from the best efficiency point, can also pose problems like excessive horsepower demand with reduced system resistance, operating in the \"break\" of the head capacity curve without corresponding flow changes, requiring more NPSH than available, and the potential for recirculation cavitation at the impeller tips.\n\nCharacteristic curves associated with centrifugal pumps can be flat, drooping, rising, stable, or unstable, influencing the pump's operational stability. Pumps with flat or drooping head characteristic curves may result in unstable operation, whereas pumps with rising head curves are preferred for steady and efficient operation. Understanding the shape of the pump curve is crucial in determining the pump's performance and suitability for a given system."

Several challenges are outlined, including the risk of overloading the horsepower due to reduced system resistance, operating at the head capacity curve break, and facing higher NPSH requirements than what may be available. The issue of recirculation cavitation at impeller tips is also emphasized.\n\nUnderstanding Pump Performance Curves\nMoving further, the text delves into the various characteristic curves associated with centrifugal pumps, such as flat, drooping, rising, stable, and unstable curves, each with distinct implications on pump operation. It underscores the importance of selecting pumps with a rising head curve to ensure stability in system operations and discusses the significance of avoiding flat or drooping head characteristic curves as they may lead to unstable flow rates.\n\nEnhancing Head Produced by Centrifugal Pumps\nThe discussion then transitions to the concept of increasing the head produced by centrifugal pumps through the application of affinity laws. These laws elucidate the relationship between flow, head, and horsepower concerning variations in impeller diameter or speed. The text elucidates that while the laws offer a theoretical framework for predicting performance variations, practical applications may deviate slightly due to factors like friction, leakage losses, and impeller design alterations.\n\nAddressing Liquid Disturbances and Preventive Measures\nLastly, the text highlights the detrimental effects of liquid disturbances in centrifugal pumps, particularly emphasizing cavitation-induced damage to pump components. The causes of damage are outlined, ranging from low-velocity cavitation to high-velocity cavitation, with detailed explanations on how these impact various pump elements.

        "Part 21": "In the previous chapter, the discussion focused on proper pump selection guidelines, emphasizing the importance of selecting a centrifugal pump at the 'heart of the curve' and ensuring the presence of sufficient NPSH to avoid mechanical damage. The objective of this chapter is to delve into the reasoning behind these requirements and offer practical guidelines for mitigating liquid disturbances in centrifugal pumps, thereby addressing persistent and costly field pump issues stemming from such disturbances.\n\nAll pumps are meticulously designed to elevate the energy of a fluid while keeping it in its liquid state. Specifically tailored to generate a defined head at a precise flow rate based on a given fluid density, each centrifugal pump's performance is intricately linked to maintaining the designated design criteria. Any deviation in fluid density leads to a proportional adjustment in flow rate, as reduced fluid density necessitates greater head to produce the same energy, resulting in a diminished flow rate.\n\nA critical factor in this context is the potential phase change of a fluid, particularly from liquid to vapor. Such a transition substantially escalates the impeller head required to meet process pressure demands, rendering the pump unable to effectively transport the product. This phenomena is commonly referred to as 'Vapor lock' or 'loss of suction,' depicting a scenario where the pump fails to sustain the necessary head, leading to a drop in discharge pressure.\n\nThe ability of a liquid to change phase within a pump is determined by its vapor pressure, which alters with temperature variations. By reducing pressure or increasing temperature, a fluid can transition between its liquid and vapor states. Moreover, controlling the pressure surrounding the liquid relative to its vapor pressure is pivotal in maintaining the liquid phase. For instance, water can transition to vapor either by increasing its temperature under constant pressure or decreasing pressure while maintaining temperature.\n\nAnalyzing the cross-section of a pump from suction flange to impeller vane reveals a fluctuation in pressure along the flow path. This pressure fluctuation is influenced by various factors such as friction losses, liquid acceleration, and shock losses at the impeller vane tips. Notably, if the pressure drop along the flow path surpasses the liquid's vapor pressure, vapor formation can occur within the impeller. Additionally, low flow velocities within the impeller can trigger flow stream separation, culminating in the creation of low-pressure areas conducive to vapor formation."

        "Part 22": "Within a pump, factors such as reducing pressure or increasing temperature can lead to phase changes in a liquid. These changes can occur due to various reasons, one of them being the alteration of pressure levels within the pump. The transition of a liquid into a vapor state can result from a combination of factors including friction losses, liquid acceleration, and shock losses. \n\nAs the liquid flows through the pump, there is a significant drop in pressure, particularly noticeable from the suction area to the impeller vanes. This pressure reduction can sometimes dip below the liquid's vapor pressure, causing vapor formation. Furthermore, low flow velocities within the impeller can create areas of low pressure, leading to vapor formation within the impeller as well.\n\nThe impeller design plays a crucial role in preventing vaporization issues within the pump. Specifically, the impeller's curvature, which often results in lower velocities on the pressure side of the vane, can contribute to vaporization due to flow separation. This phenomenon, known as recirculation, can have a detrimental impact on pump efficiency and liquid temperature, ultimately affecting the vapor pressure of the fluid.\n\nLow flow operations can exacerbate the situation, diminishing impeller efficiency and causing temperature rises, which in turn raise the vapor pressure of the liquid. Liquids with low specific gravity and high vapor pressures are particularly vulnerable to vaporization during low flow conditions, especially when coupled with increased wear ring clearances that facilitate mixing of different temperature liquids.\n\nMitigating vaporization and preventing cavitation are crucial aspects in maintaining the efficiency and integrity of centrifugal pumps. By addressing issues such as inlet pressure losses, recirculation flow, and low flow temperature rise, the risks of cavitation and subsequent pump damage can be minimized. Strategies to prevent cavitation will be explored in detail in subsequent discussions within this chapter to ensure the longevity and performance of the pump components."

        "Part 23": "Within a centrifugal pump, vaporization can occur due to low flows, causing cavitation. When the pressure of the liquid surpasses its vapor pressure, cavitation results from the collapse of vapor bubbles. Preventing cavitation involves avoiding vapor formation within the pump, as shown in Figure 6.14. Methods for prevention will be elaborated on later in this chapter.\n\nCavitation leads to energy release from inlet pressure losses, recirculation, or low flow temperature rise. The released energy varies based on fluid type and degree of vaporization, impacting component damage. Single component liquids exhibit higher energy values during cavitation compared to hydrocarbon mixtures with lower viscosities. Noise levels during cavitation can be significant, resembling the sound of solid rocks passing through the pump.\n\nDifferent causes of vaporization contribute to cavitation, emphasizing the importance of preventing hydraulic disturbances. Addressing liquid disturbances in centrifugal pumps requires proactive measures during the project design phase to eliminate sources of vaporization. Specific speed, a crucial factor influenced by pump speed, flow, and head, plays a key role in optimizing pump efficiency and design elements.\n\nEfficiency in pump design is depicted in Figure 6.16, showcasing the relationship between pump specific speed and flow. Net positive suction head available (NPSHA) must exceed the required NPSH to prevent cavitation. NPSH requirements are illustrated in Figure 6.17, reflecting the pressure drop from the suction flange to the impeller vane inlet. Meeting NPSHA greater than NPSHR ensures no vaporization, hence preventing cavitation and subsequent damage.\n\nWhile NPSHA exceeding NPSHR is critical, other factors such as low velocity stall and low flow temperature rise must also be addressed to prevent vaporization. Determining these factors involves understanding suction specific speed (Nss), a parameter derived from the equation for specific speed with NPSHR as a substitute for pump head (H). Make sure to consider all causes of vaporization to maintain pump efficiency and prevent cavitation effectively."

        "Part 24": "Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH) plays a crucial role in preventing cavitation within a centrifugal pump. The NPSH required is the pressure drop from the suction flange to the impeller vane inlet, expressed in energy terms. It is essential for NPSH available to exceed NPSH required to avoid vaporization, cavitation, and subsequent damage to the pump.\n\nOne of the factors to consider in preventing vaporization and cavitation is the suction specific speed (Nss), which focuses on the impeller inlet and its relation to the impeller inlet velocity. Nss is determined by the equation Nss = N / NPSHR, where N is the speed and NPSHR is the Net Positive Suction Head Required. The relationship between NPSHR, Nss, inlet velocity, inlet pressure drop, and flow separation probability is depicted in Figure 6.18.\n\nFlow separation is more likely to occur at high specific speeds resulting from low inlet velocity. Understanding the critical flow conditions that lead to cavitation is essential for pump users. The onset of recirculation increases with rising suction specific speed, where higher Nss values indicate a quicker onset of cavitation when operating below the Best Efficiency Point (BEP).\n\nDefining the process system and ensuring accurate liquid characteristics are crucial steps in selecting a pump that operates without hydraulic disturbances. By accurately defining process requirements and operating ranges, hydraulic calculations can determine the necessary flows, heads, and NPSH available. Selecting a pump that aligns with these requirements is key to trouble-free operation.\n\nGuidelines for selecting pumps free of hydraulic disturbances include confirming NPSHA exceeds NPSHR at maximum operating flow, ensuring an NPSH margin at both maximum and minimum operating flows, and selecting a pump type that can operate effectively under all conditions outlined in Figure 6.22. By following these guidelines and understanding the principles behind preventing liquid disturbances, a suitable pump can be chosen to meet process requirements effectively."

Once the process requirements are well-defined, a suitable pump can be chosen to meet these needs without risking hydraulic disturbances. Referencing Figure 6.23, it is essential to consider three critical areas to ensure trouble-free operation: NPSH margin at maximum operating flow, approximate recirculation margin at minimum operating flow, and NPSH margin at minimum operating flow. By adhering to these considerations, a pump can be selected that allows for reliable operation under various conditions, as depicted in Figure 6.22.\n\nGuidelines for selecting a pump free of hydraulic disturbances are outlined in Figure 6.24. These guidelines emphasize confirming NPSHA and NPSHR at maximum operating flow, adjusting suction drum level and temperature as necessary, and recalculating Nss based on BEP conditions. It is crucial to compare cavitation flow to the minimum operating flow and install necessary measures such as a minimum flow bypass or parallel pump operation if needed.\n\nTechnical discussions with the pump vendor are recommended to address specific conditions, ensuring the selected pump is suitable for the application. Understanding the NPSHR curve and its implications at low flows is crucial. Liquid disturbances at low flows are attributed to factors like flow separation and temperature rise, impacting the vapor pressure of the pumped liquid. To maintain trouble-free operation, discussions with the pump vendor regarding the NPSHR curve and the pumped liquid characteristics are essential for project success.\n\nMoreover, justifying the selection of trouble-free pumps involves considering not only project costs but also the total cost of operating unreliable pumps over the project's lifespan. By evaluating Case Histories of problem pumps, operating companies can make informed decisions on pump selection based on reliability and long-term cost-effectiveness (Refer to Figure 6.25).\n\nDetecting and addressing hydraulic disturbances in field operations require monitoring indicators like loud noise, pressure pulsations, and high vibration levels, as indicated in Figure 6.26. Identifying the root cause of disturbances is crucial for maintaining pump reliability and performance throughout the operational phase. By ensuring proactive measures and proper pump selection, operational efficiency and longevity can be maximized in project design and implementation."

It is recommended to engage in technical discussions with the pump vendor when needed to ensure a comprehensive understanding. An essential inquiry concerning the typical pump performance curve is raised before proceeding – specifically, the reason why the NPSHR curve is not extended to zero flow like the head curve.\n\nUnderstanding that the standard shop test fluid for all pumps is water, the cessation of the NPSHR curve at the point where flow separation and liquid temperature rise could trigger liquid disturbances is explained. It is crucial to acknowledge that trouble-free operation to the left of this point is contingent upon the characteristics of the pumped liquid and necessitates consultation with the pump vendor to avert liquid disturbances effectively.\n\nTo ascertain the justification of necessary actions regarding pump selection, a meticulous evaluation of both the process and pump attributes is indispensable. Operating companies are advised to look beyond just project costs and consider the potential production losses incurred due to hydraulic disturbances in pumps. Case histories of problematic pumps can provide valuable insights into the overall costs associated with unreliable pumps throughout the project lifespan.\n\nIn the subsequent section, the focus shifts towards ensuring optimal pump reliability during the project design phase. The text proceeds to elaborate on the identification and rectification of hydraulic disturbances in the field. Detecting hydraulic disturbances involves observing key indicators such as loud noises, pressure pulsations, and unusual vibration patterns, as highlighted in Figure 6.26.\n\nOnce hydraulic disturbances are detected, determining the root cause becomes paramount. Vaporization of liquid is identified as a prerequisite for cavitation to manifest, thereby emphasizing the significance of pinpointing the root causes of vaporization. Subsequent actions involve confirming process conditions, conducting specific tests, and verifying the NPSHA value to address the issue effectively.\n\nThe confirmation of NPSHA and the subsequent recommended actions are detailed for maintaining optimal pump performance. Various solutions, such as modifying pump operation or the impeller design, are proposed to mitigate the impact of high velocity cavitation and ensure quiet pump operation.\n\nThe document further discusses internal pressure loss testing and suggests solutions to address high-velocity cavitation issues. It emphasizes the importance of consulting the pump vendor for viable solutions and details recommended inlet piping arrangements to prevent hydraulic disturbances caused by process piping configurations.\n\nLastly, a test is outlined to confirm low flow hydraulic disturbances, with corresponding actions to address potential issues arising from low flow circulation or temperature rise.

If direct modification is not viable, alternative options include operating the pump at a reduced flow rate to decrease NPSHR or adjusting the pump design to lower NPSHR at the operating flow rate.\n\nTo confirm the NPSHA and determine the recommended course of action, the predicted value of NPSHA should be obtained and calculated using the current conditions. If the actual NPSHA is below the predicted NPSHA, methods such as increasing NPSHA if feasible, operating the pump at a lower flow rate (if cost-effective), or modifying the pump to reduce NPSHR can be implemented.\n\nIn case of high velocity cavitation being confirmed due to high liquid disturbance caused by high liquid velocity, solutions are offered to address the issue. These solutions include increasing NPSHA until quiet operation is achieved, reducing pump throughput if feasible, running two pumps in parallel, enlarging the impeller eye area, changing impeller material, or purchasing a new pump with acceptable conditions.\n\nRegarding solutions for high velocity cavitation, adjusting the impeller eye area may not always be feasible, and consultation with the pump vendor is necessary to ensure the possibility and effectiveness of this modification. Furthermore, before concluding this topic, it is essential to mention the significance of the inlet piping arrangement, which, if not in accordance with the guidelines provided, can lead to hydraulic disturbances due to factors like entrained vapor, internal pressure increase caused by turbulence, or liquid separation from impeller vanes.\n\nInlet piping arrangements should adhere to certain principles to avoid hydraulic disturbances caused by process piping, such as running the piping vertically or horizontally into the pump without creating high pockets that could lead to vapor formation, maintaining minimum straight suction pipe runs, ensuring appropriate orientations of pipe elbows for double suction pumps, and positioning the 'belly' of an eccentric reducer at the bottom location.\n\nTo address low flow hydraulic disturbances, solutions may involve increasing pump flow rate until quiet operation is achieved, modifying the inlet volute to enhance impeller inlet velocity, installing an impeller with reduced eye area if sufficient NPSHA is present, or incorporating a minimum flow bypass to escalate flow rate and eliminate low flow temperature rise.\n\nFinally, the resolution of hydraulic disturbances necessitates a cost-effective action plan endorsed by management to mitigate revenue loss resulting from unforeseen equipment downtime. The mechanical design and manufacture quality significantly impact pump performance optimization and availability, emphasizing the importance of understanding and maintaining the components of centrifugal pumps, both hydraulic and mechanical, for effective operation."

        "Part 28": "The volute is a crucial part of the pump casing, responsible for collecting and discharging the liquid using centrifugal force post-impeller action. As depicted in Figure 7.2, the volute continually accumulates more liquid as it moves around the casing, necessitating a steady increase in the volute area between the impeller tip and casing wall to maintain a constant liquid velocity with increasing volume. \n\nDifferent casing designs can lead to uneven pressure distribution around the impeller. For instance, a single volute casing, typical in single stage overhung impeller pumps designed for high heads, may cause imbalanced pressure resulting in shaft deflection and increased bearing loads at off-design conditions. In contrast, a dual volute casing, as shown in Figure 7.3, equalizes pressure around the impeller, thereby reducing unbalanced bearing loads. \n\nTo further balance pressure in multistage volute pumps and minimize liquid leakage, staggered volutes or double volute designs are available. Additionally, the use of vaned diffusers aids in converting kinetic energy to pressure energy gradually, as shown in Figure 7.5. \n\nWear rings play a vital role in reducing leakage within centrifugal pumps and are usually installed at critical points within the pump casing and impeller to minimize flow back to the suction side. Proper wear ring clearances, advised by API Standard 610, are crucial to maintain pump efficiency over time.\n\nThe impeller, regarded as the heart of the centrifugal pump, is responsible for producing head. It comes in two basic designs - enclosed and open, each serving different purposes. The enclosed impeller design contains liquid flow between shrouds, ensuring minimal flow along the walls. In comparison, the open impeller design, though less efficient, requires close clearance between the impeller and casing wall to reduce recirculation from areas with varying pressures. \n\nDifferent impeller types, such as single suction and double suction, dictate the number of inlets to the impeller. The features of the impeller impact pump performance, with the double suction impeller providing increased suction area for improved capacity at lower positive suction head levels."

Pump efficiency may slightly decrease when using API clearances. The impeller plays a vital role in pump operation by generating head. There are two main impeller designs: enclosed and open. The enclosed impeller design contains liquid between front and back shrouds, while the open impeller design minimizes recirculation.\n\nFlow circulation is minimized in the open impeller design through close clearance operation. Although the open impeller is less efficient than the enclosed type, it allows for adjustments to maintain optimal clearance. Additionally, hydrocarbon service typically does not widely use the open impeller. Impellers can be classified based on suction type, either single or double. Double suction impellers have two inlets, providing increased suction area and reducing the NPSH required for operation.\n\nSpecific speed is a critical factor in pump design, as it optimizes various design aspects such as impeller flow velocity and blade angles. Bearings in pumps are essential for supporting rotating elements under different loads. Bearing failures can be caused by various factors like increased process pipe forces or improper assembly clearances. There are three basic types of bearings used in centrifugal pumps: hydrodynamic ring oil lubricated, hydrodynamic pressure lubricated, and anti-friction bearings.\n\nFor centrifugal pumps in the process industry, appropriate bearings are crucial. The L-10 rating life defines the operational lifespan before bearing failure. API Standard 610 recommends pressurized hydrodynamic bearings for high-powered pumps. Additionally, the dN number is used to measure frictional heat generation and determine appropriate bearing size and lubrication type. Understanding these factors is essential for selecting the right bearings for optimal pump performance."

The relationship governing bearing performance involves factors such as pressure on the supporting oil film or element, total static and dynamic forces on the bearing, and the bearing area. \n\nFailure of pump bearings, which may perform reliably for years, can occur abruptly due to changes in forces acting on the bearing. Various factors can increase bearing load, including increased process pipe forces, foundation forces, fouling of the impeller, improper assembly clearances, thermal expansion, radial forces, and poor piping layouts.\n\nCentrifugal pumps in the process industry are typically equipped with bearings suitable for the application and pump design. The L-10 rating life for anti-friction bearings defines the number of hours at rated bearing load that 90% of identical bearings will operate before showing signs of failure. Pressurized hydrodynamic bearings are recommended when the product of pump rated horsepower and speed exceeds 2.7 million. \n\nThe dN number, calculated based on bearing size and rated speed, is utilized to assess generated frictional heat and determine the appropriate bearing type and lubrication. Anti-friction bearings, particularly ball bearings, are commonly used in centrifugal pumps for carrying radial and thrust loads, each type offering distinct advantages for specific load requirements.\n\nAnti-friction bearing lubrication aims to enhance bearing life, maintain separation between balls/rollers, dissipate heat, and prevent corrosion. Methods such as ring oil and flooded lubrication are commonly employed, with constant level oilers ensuring consistent oil levels in the bearing housing. Oil mist lubrication is an emerging method that provides controlled lubrication to both operating and non-operating pumps, particularly advantageous in environments with sand or salt presence."

Specific applications of this bearing type are determined by the manufacturer and are usually not a user-selectable option. The goal of lubricating anti-friction bearings is to prolong bearing life, maintain separation between balls or rollers, dissipate heat, and prevent corrosion. Oil lubrication for ball and roller bearings commonly involves ring oil and flooded methods, both typically incorporating constant level oilers to maintain oil at a specified height within the housing, not the actual bearing level.\n\nIn flooded lubrication, the oil level is kept around the center of the lowest bearing by maintaining a reservoir level. Proper oil level should be confirmed through visual inspection or utilizing mist lubrication, offering controlled lubrication in both operating and non-operating conditions, particularly important in environments with sand or salts present. \n\nOil mist lubrication, another acceptable method for anti-friction bearings, utilizes a mist generator to supply air and atomized oil, resulting in benefits such as reduced operating temperatures, low oil consumption, and prevention of grit or contaminants due to pressurized air. Additionally, features of the oil mist system include a continuous supply of lubricant and the option to integrate ring oil as a backup system termed the \"wet sump system.\"\n\nHydrodynamic bearings are designed to provide continuous support to the rotor with an oil film under one-thousandth of an inch thick. Various bearing types are available, such as sleeve bearings typically used in centrifugal pumps for radial support, while tilt pad journal bearings are utilized in high-power, high-speed pumps for enhanced rotor stability. Multilobe bearings, though less common, can provide increased damping and stiffness for lightly loaded bearings. The performance of hydrodynamic bearings involves oil film dynamics resulting in an equilibrium point of minimum clearance.\n\nIndustry guidelines recommend unit pressure values for bearings ranging from 50 to 300 PSI, exceeding which may lead to breakdown of the oil film and potential metal-to-metal contact. Guidelines also highlight factors influencing unit pressure such as static and dynamic forces and bearing dimensions.\n\nIn pump mechanical design, balancing devices are crucial for managing thrust in single suction and multi-stage pumps. Double suction impellers are theoretically in hydraulic balance, while single suction impellers require hydraulic balancing to limit thrust towards the suction side. Impeller design configurations for multi-stage pumps aim to minimize thrust, with methods like opposed impeller arrangements or hydraulic balance devices utilized."

As the speed of rotation increases, the oil drawn under the journal builds up pressure, forcing the journal upwards and towards the right in the direction of rotation until a point of minimum clearance is reached. The pressure distribution across the bearing varies, with the maximum unit pressure reaching a value about twice the average pressure on the projected area of the bearing. The permissible unit pressure is a function of static and dynamic forces and the dimensions of the bearing, typically ranging from 50 to 300 PSI for continuously loaded bearings. Pressures exceeding 300 PSI can potentially lead to the breakdown of the oil film, resulting in metal to metal contact. The average unit pressure on the projected area of the bearing is calculated by the equation Z.\n\nThe absolute viscosity of the lubricant and various factors such as journal surface velocity, journal diameter, diametral clearance between the journal and bearing, alongside a factor depending on bearing construction and ratio of length to journal diameter play crucial roles in bearing pressure distribution. Balancing devices are instrumental in managing thrust in rotating equipment, such as single suction and multi-stage pumps which require hydraulic balancing to control thrust, while double suction impellers are theoretically in hydraulic balance. The thrust on a single suction impeller is typically directed towards the suction. Different methods are employed to minimize impeller thrust in multi-stage pumps, either through opposed impeller design or hydraulic balance devices.\n\nFor multi-stage pumps with tandem impeller arrangements, the balance drum serves as the conventional method to minimize hydraulic axial thrust. It is advisable to intentionally design the balance drum with some residual thrust to prevent the rotor from moving back and forth. The thrust bearing is sized considering the net thrust load from impellers and leakage, along with added thrust load due to increased balance drum clearance and the thrust load from the coupling. When conducting a Root Cause Failure Analysis for a shaft and/or keyway change or operating equipment at an increased power of over 25%, shaft and key stresses should be evaluated. The limiting factor for shaft and/or key stress is always the shear stress produced by the equipment's load or torque. The relationship for shear stress calculation is illustrated, considering torque and shaft diameter. It is essential to check shaft and key stress when observing damage or when modifying equipment to transmit additional power.\n\nLastly, mechanical seals play a vital role in the seal system of centrifugal pump applications, controlling flush flow and preventing the escape of pumped liquid. The stuffing box, which is exposed to the atmosphere and through which the rotating shaft or reciprocating rod passes, needs to be properly sealed to ensure effective operation. Mechanical seals are commonly employed in these setups to enhance efficiency."

Thrust bearing is sized to handle the net thrust load from impellers, leakage, and additional thrust load caused by increased clearance of the balance drum.\n\nShaft Shear Stress is crucial and is calculated based on the Transmitted Torque and Shaft Diameter to the 3rd power. Mechanical seals play a vital role in centrifugal pump applications by preventing pumped liquid from escaping. The seal system consists of stationary and rotating components that create a net face loading closure force to prevent fluid escape to the atmosphere. Proper lubrication and cooling are essential for satisfactory seal performance over time.\n\nTo prevent vaporization, the liquid flush pressure must be controlled relative to the liquid's vapor pressure at its temperature. A reliable and trouble-free operation of the seal system requires perfect contact and alignment of seal faces, along with proper lubrication and cooling.

Consequently, it can be inferred that all seals exhibit some degree of leakage, which is influenced by the pressure drop across the faces. This performance can be likened to flow through an equivalent orifice. The amount of heat generated at the seal face is determined by face loading and friction coefficient, factors that are tied to material selection and lubrication.\n\nAs the lubricant traverses the interface, the likelihood of vaporization increases, with the point of vaporization onset contingent on the flush liquid pressure in relation to the liquid's vapor pressure at the given temperature. The closer the liquid flush pressure aligns with the liquid's vapor pressure at the specific temperature, the sooner vaporization occurs. \n\nFor reliable and trouble-free operation over extended periods, it is vital for the seal to function within a controlled environment. Proper installation, ensuring perfect contact and alignment of seal faces, along with adequate lubrication and cooling, is crucial. A basic seal system comprises the seal, stuffing box throat bushing, liquid flush system, auxiliary seal, and auxiliary flush or barrier fluid when necessary. The seal's primary role is to prevent the escape of pumped product into the atmosphere, while the liquid flush provides lubrication and cooling.\n\nIn controlling the flush flow to the seal, a simple system typically integrates an orifice in the flush line from the pump discharge to the mechanical seal to regulate the flow rate and pressure in the seal chamber. Notably, various causes of seal failures can be identified during operation, and prompt corrective actions can mitigate potential issues. Examination of symptoms indicating possible failure causes aids in preventive maintenance and operational optimization.\n\nMechanical seals, being the predominant type utilized in centrifugal pumps today, come in diverse configurations based on application service conditions or user preference. Single mechanical seals are commonly employed and are suitable for applications involving non-toxic and non-flammable liquids.

To address these issues, it is recommended to ensure a proper liquid environment for the product at all times, consider increasing seal chamber pressure within operating parameters, check for proper seal balance, adjust seal design if necessary, and potentially enlarge the seal flush line. It is essential to accurately measure seal chamber pressure, temperature, and product sample for vapor pressure determination when reviewing seal balance.\n\nSingle mechanical seals are commonly used in centrifugal pumps for applications where the liquid is non-toxic and non-flammable. In situations where toxic or flammable liquids are involved, tandem mechanical seals are preferred, consisting of two seals – primary and back-up. The primary seal is flushed by a selected seal flush plan, while the back-up seal is equipped with a flush system using a low flash point liquid. A pressure alarm alerts for increasing stuffing box pressure between the primary and back-up seal, indicating a primary seal failure.\n\nDouble mechanical seals are employed in applications where leakage of the pumped fluid to the atmosphere is unacceptable, such as in H2S service or alkylation services. These seals prevent fluid leakage by providing a continuous barrier liquid at a higher pressure than the pumped fluid. Double seal systems typically include a reservoir, cooler, pressure switch, and control valve to maintain a safe barrier against leakage.\n\nLiquid/gas tandem mechanical seal applications involve a primary liquid seal and a gas seal acting as a back-up seal, particularly beneficial in low specific gravity applications where the pumped fluid easily vaporizes. This configuration offers advantages over conventional tandem liquid seals.\n\nAdditionally, a double gas seal configuration utilizes two gas seals with N2 or air as a buffer to prevent leakage of pumped fluid to atmosphere, requiring compatibility between the pumped product and the gas introduced.

For instance, API flush plan 31 involves routing fluid from the pump case through a cyclone separator to separate solids before returning the clean fluid to the seal, while fluid with solids is directed back to the pump suction.\n\nAdditionally, the guidelines for using cyclones emphasize factors like differential pressure, solids density, and particle size to optimize separation efficiency. It is recommended not to use cyclones when the pressure is below 25 Psi and consider alternative methods like orifice when the pressure exceeds cyclone capabilities.\n\nIn cases where a clean and cool seal flush is necessary to prevent solids accumulation, an external liquid flush system (Plan 32) can be employed. This system maintains higher fluid pressure than behind the impeller to ensure flow towards the pump suction, preventing contaminated product from flowing back into the seal chamber.\n\nMoreover, high temperature product flush systems (Plan 23) are beneficial for maintaining proper pressure differentials and cooler operation in scenarios requiring temperature control above 400°F. These systems utilize a throat bushing and a circulating device to manage heat generated by the seal faces efficiently.\n\nFor applications involving low-temperature liquids prone to ice formation, a low-temperature product flush/buffer system (Plan 52) with a tandem seal and buffer liquid is recommended. The buffer liquid, typically methanol, is contained in a seal pot vented to a lower pressure system to prevent excessive seal leakage. Proper system monitoring and alarm features are crucial to ensure prompt action in case of inner seal product leakage issues."

This system utilizes a seal pot containing the buffer liquid, often methanol, which is vented to a lower pressure system. Circulation within the seal pot is maintained through recirculation from the pump case, passing through orifices and heat exchangers, and then returning to the seal chamber through a mechanical seals vent at a high point location. This configuration is designed to handle low-temperature applications where seal faces may be prone to icing if exposed to atmospheric conditions. Plan 52, or the low temperature product flush/buffer system, is particularly suitable for substances like ethylene and propylene that are vulnerable to seal face damage due to ice formation.\n\nPlan 51, on the other hand, provides a solution for situations where atmosphere leakage cannot be accepted. It employs a dead-ended system design, ensuring that the inner seal product leakage is adequately managed through the orifice vent system. Additionally, a switch mechanism is incorporated to sound an alarm if the inner seal leakage cannot be properly handled. In such cases, immediate pump shutdown is essential to prevent any potential failure of the backup seal, which would result in fluid leakage to the environment.\n\nFor toxic or flammable products where any leakage to the atmosphere is intolerable, plan 53 is recommended. This system involves a dual seal setup with a barrier liquid separating the seals. It relies on a seal pot to maintain the barrier liquid at a pressure higher than the seal chamber to ensure that any inner seal leakage is directed back into the pump, minimizing product contamination.\n\nPlan 54 represents a dual system utilizing pressurized barrier liquid from an external source to supply clean, cool liquid to the seal chamber. The barrier liquid pressure is maintained higher than the seal chamber pressure to prevent any inward leakage. This system, though complex and costly, is recognized for its reliability and is suitable for applications where product containment integrity is of paramount importance. In cases of seal failure, the auxiliary stuffing box can serve as an emergency containment device, providing a restricted flow seal to prevent fluid leaks.\n\nIt is advised to promptly shut down the pump upon detecting any leakage from the auxiliary stuffing box without adequate quench supply. Proper drainage arrangements for the auxiliary stuffing box are essential to meet environmental regulations. Additionally, the use of a quench fluid can help dissolve hard deposits that may form, preventing wear on the seal faces. In refinery applications, low-pressure steam is often employed for this purpose, ensuring the cleanliness and operational efficiency of the sealing system."
    },
    {
        "Part 39": "The pump should be shut down immediately in the event of leakage observed from the auxiliary stuffing box if a quench is not supplied. It is always a good practice to require that the auxiliary stuffing box drain connection be piped to a drain system that meets environmental standards. The auxiliary stuffing box is utilized to contain a quench fluid that will dissolve hard deposits at the exit of the seal faces when the pumped fluid can vaporize and form hard deposits. A typical refinery quench application involves using low-pressure steam to dissolve coke deposits on the seal face, which also helps in keeping the standby pump seal warm to prevent thermal expansion issues during start-up. In certain applications where solid deposits need to be flushed from the seal face, a water flush is used, with two rows of packing provided in the auxiliary stuffing box to minimize external water leakage. \n\nRegarding compressor types and applications, positive displacement compressors and dynamic compressors are the two basic classifications, with positive displacement compressors being constant volume machines and dynamic compressors being variable volume machines affected by gas characteristics. The selection of the compressor type for a specific application depends on factors such as flow rate, pressure requirements, and gas characteristics. Dynamic compressors are generally preferred due to lower maintenance requirements, followed by rotary type positive displacement compressors and reciprocating compressors. The selection is further based on application requirements and considerations. Table 9.1 outlines the typical operating ranges for various types of gas compressors, while Table 9.2 describes the typical applications for the different compressor types."

These compressors are efficient and capable of operating oil-free in the gas path. Utilizing two lobes per rotor, gas is trapped and compressed against system backpressure. Noise enclosures are typically provided to mitigate the high noise levels associated with rotary lobe compressors.\n\nOn the other hand, sliding-vane rotary compressors employ vanes that move against the casing wall due to centrifugal force, creating cells that draw gas in through the inlet port. As the cell volume varies, the gas pressure increases, leading to discharge through the outlet port. Though effective, sliding-vane compressors are known for their noisy operation.\n\nAdditionally, single-stage screw compressors involve male and female rotors meshing in a dual-bore cylinder. A foil seal prevents metal contact between the rotors, with lubrication often utilized for plant and instrument air service. Alternatively, dry screw-type compressors are available, eliminating the need for lubrication. Compression starts as the rotors enmesh at the inlet port, drawing gas into the cavity for compression.\n\nLiquid ring rotary compressors consist of a multi-blade rotor revolving in an elliptical casing partially filled with liquid. As the rotor turns, the liquid forms buckets that move with the rotor, alternating in filling and emptying between the blades. This design allows for efficient gas compression within the liquid ring system."

The male rotor typically features four helical threads spaced 90 degrees apart, while the female rotor has six helical grooves spaced 60 degrees apart. The rotor speed ratio is inversely related to the thread-groove ratio, such as in a four-thread, six-groove screw compressor, where the male rotor at 1800 rpm drives the female rotor at 1200 rpm. To maintain a seal and prevent metal-to-metal contact, a foil film is introduced between the rotors. While an oil-mist eliminator is usually necessary downstream of the compressor for plant and instrument air service, lubrication-free designs are also available.\n\nCompression in the screw compressor begins as the rotors mesh at the inlet port, trapping gas in the cell formed by the rotor cavities and cylinder wall. Subsequent rotation causes the male rotor thread to enter the female rotor groove, reducing the cell volume and increasing pressure. Oil injection occurs after cell closure to seal clearances and absorb compression heat. Compression progresses until the rotors pass the discharge port, releasing the compressed gas and oil mixture.\n\nRotary liquid ring compressors consist of a round rotor revolving in an elliptical casing partially filled with liquid, typically water. As the rotor rotates, blades create buckets that carry liquid around the rotor. Gas is drawn into the rotor chamber through inlet ports as the liquid leaves the chamber, then compressed as the volume decreases. The compressed gas is discharged into a separator before entering the process.\n\nReciprocating compressors feature components like crankshafts, pistons, cylinders, valves, and rods. The compression cycle involves suction and compression strokes of the piston. The suction stroke begins by drawing gas into the cylinder, followed by the compression stroke raising the gas pressure until discharge. The reciprocating compressor operates in stages, with each stage further compressing the gas until final discharge.\n\nDynamic compressors, known for low maintenance requirements, offer alternatives to positive displacement compressors. Centrifugal compressors operate by increasing the gas's tangential velocity to boost energy, akin to a centrifugal pump's operation. Gas enters through the inlet nozzle into the impeller with minimal shock or turbulence, mounted on a rotating shaft for compression."

        "Part 42": "The compression cycle of a reciprocating compressor involves two key strokes of the piston: the suction stroke and the compression stroke. The suction stroke initiates as the piston moves away from the inlet port of the cylinder, allowing gas to enter until the piston reaches the end of its stroke. Subsequently, the compression stroke commences as the piston reverses its movement, trapping the gas inside the cylinder by closing the suction valve. This process leads to an increase in gas pressure within the cylinder. \n\nUpon reaching the designated pressure for the stage, the discharge valve opens, releasing the compressed contents from the cylinder to the suction of the subsequent stages. This cascading compression process continues through multiple stages, each building upon the work of the previous stage to achieve the final discharge pressure. \n\nDynamic compressors, such as centrifugal compressors, operate by enhancing the gas energy through increasing its tangential velocity. The gas enters the compressor through an inlet nozzle designed to minimize shock and turbulence, then proceeds to the impeller where dynamic compression occurs. The impeller, consisting of blades mounted on a shaft, facilitates gas compression by increasing its energy. The diffuser surrounding the impeller converts the velocity energy into higher pressure levels.\n\nIn single-stage compressors, the gas exits the diffuser via a volute casing, while in multi-stage compressors, return vanes direct the gas to the subsequent impeller stage. Various configurations of centrifugal compressors, including single stage overhung, single stage integral gear, multi-stage horizontal split, multi-stage with side loads, and multi-stage integral gear, cater to different application needs based on factors such as speed, energy requirements, and operational pressure ranges."

The gas enters the inlet nozzle, which guides it to the inlet volute. The inlet volute accelerates the gas stream into the stator vanes, which turn the gas stream to align it properly with the blades. The blades increase the gas energy by raising its velocity. The stator vanes serve as diffusers, offering resistance to the gas flow, causing the gas stream to decrease in velocity and increase in pressure. The stator vanes also orient the gas stream correctly for the next set of blades. With alternating blades and stator vanes down the casing length, the gas is both accelerated and decelerated multiple times before exiting the compressor. Pressure increases each time the gas flow encounters a set of stator vanes, and the gas exits through the discharge volute and discharge nozzle."

The stator vanes align the gas with the blades, increasing its energy by raising its velocity. As the gas flows through the compressor, it undergoes multiple accelerations and decelerations, increasing pressure with each encounter with the stator vanes. The compressed gas exits through the discharge volute and nozzle. \n\nFluid head is defined as the energy required to compress and deliver one pound of a fluid from one level to another. It can be expressed in foot-pounds force per pound mass or British Thermal Units per pound. The energy required to compress a gas is significantly higher than that of a liquid due to the lower density of gases. Types of gas heads, such as isothermal, isentropic, adiabatic, and polytropic, describe the compression paths. Understanding Mollier Diagrams aids in visualizing the energy and pressure relationships in compression processes.\n\nThe amount of energy needed to compress fluids varies based on their densities. While water requires relatively little energy to compress, gases like nitrogen demand significantly more due to their lower mass. The type of compressor used also affects flow rates; positive displacement compressors maintain flow regardless of head requirements, whereas dynamic compressors experience reduced flow rates with increased head requirements. Reduced flow rates in dynamic compressors can lead to mechanical damage."

The density of the fluid significantly influences the amount of energy (head) needed in the compression process. Water, with a density of 62.4 lbs/ft³, requires only 231 ft-lb force per lb mass to compress the liquid at 100 PSl, independent of temperature. On the contrary, nitrogen, with a density of 0.07 lbs/ft³, demands approximately 350 times more energy due to its lower mass compared to water.\n\nThe process mandates that both water and nitrogen be compressed at 100 PSl. However, the disparity in mass between the two fluids results in a significantly higher energy requirement for compressing nitrogen. Positive displacement compressors exhibit consistent flow rates regardless of the head required, while dynamic compressors' flow rates are notably affected by changes in the head required during the process. Dynamic compressors can only produce higher energy levels at lower flow rates due to their operating characteristics.\n\nUnderstanding the connection between the needed energy for the process and the energy produced by the compressor is crucial for dynamic compressor operation. Failure to comprehend these concepts may lead to mechanical damage within the compressor unit. Various factors govern the energy required by a process system, with gas density playing a pivotal role. As gas density fluctuates due to changes in temperature, pressure, or molecular weight, the energy needed for the process adjusts accordingly, impacting the dynamic compressor's flow rate accordingly.\n\nThe factors determining the energy produced by a dynamic compressor include impeller design, diameter, and speed. The head produced by the impeller is a function of these factors, with mechanical damage or fouling being potential causes for deviation from expected performance. Monitoring the head produced by the dynamic compressor is essential, as any significant deviation from expected values could indicate the need for inspection to prevent potential mechanical damage."

The text explains that the head produced by a dynamic compressor is fixed by its design and varies with flow rate. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining the compressor within ±10% of the expected performance curve to avoid maintenance issues.\n\nAdditionally, the text introduces the concept of fluid head using Mollier diagrams to determine energy requirements for compressing liquids and vapors. Different paths of compression, such as isothermal, isentropic, and polytropic, are discussed along with the ideal gas head equations. The polytropic head is highlighted as a standard for multistage compressors due to its efficiency term allowing for the summation of individual impeller heads.\n\nFurthermore, the text addresses the formatting of dynamic compressor curves and the influence of gas density on the head required by the process.

Finally, different ways that compressor compression performance can be formatted are presented in Figure 10.10. Head vs. flow is always preferred because the head produced by a dynamic compressor is not significantly affected by gas density. Compression ratio or discharge pressure curves are invalid if there are changes in inlet gas temperature, inlet pressure, or molecular weight. Gas density influences the head required by the process. To achieve the client's objective, the compressor vendor must calculate the actual flow to the compressor inlet, the actual energy, and work required. Gas characteristics are crucial in determining design parameters for the compressor. Compressibility, power, and mass flow rate are key factors in the calculation process."

Therefore, given the required flow and energy (head), the only way for the vendor to achieve higher specific speed is by increasing the compressor speed. This is crucial as compressors have seen improvements in efficiency but also higher bore impeller stresses, which can lead to reliability issues. The impeller design needs to carefully balance performance requirements with mechanical constraints of compressor components. Efficiency is illustrated as a ratio of ideal energy to actual energy on a Mollier Diagram. The fan laws demonstrate how impeller energy can be increased through speed adjustments in compressor applications. \n\nTo meet the end user's objective of delivering a specific amount of gas, process control systems typically monitor pressure and use controllers to modulate flow or adjust the compressor speed accordingly. The vendor calculates the head required by the process based on parameters provided by the contractor and end user. Confirming accurate process conditions is essential to ensure the compressor operates optimally.\n\nGas characteristics play a key role in determining design parameters for compressors. These characteristics include compressibility, specific heat, specific heat ratio, molecular weight, and polytropic exponent. The relationships used in compressor calculations are standardized regardless of the compressor type. Efficient performance is attained by calculating actual flow, energy, and work required for gas compression and delivery.\n\nVarious impeller types, such as open and enclosed impellers, offer distinct advantages and disadvantages in terms of head production and efficiency. Open impellers operate at higher tip speeds, generating greater head but with lower efficiency compared to closed impellers. Enclosed impellers, on the other hand, minimize leakage and blade stresses, making them suitable for various compressor applications.\n\nImpeller selection is crucial in meeting process requirements, with modern calculation and manufacturing methods allowing for the use of enclosed first stage impellers in multistage compressor applications. The choice between open and enclosed impellers depends on factors like system resistance and application requirements, ultimately impacting compressor stability and performance."

They can generate 15,000 - 25,000 ft-lbs/LB of head per stage due to the absence of a side plate attached to the vane inlet, leading to reduced blade stresses. However, open impellers are less efficient due to increased shroud leakage and a higher number of blade natural frequencies resulting from the cantilevered blade attachment. Typically, open impellers are limited to applications such as plant and instrument air usage, where the high speeds and intercooling can offset the efficiency drawbacks linked to shroud leakage.\n\nOn the other hand, enclosed impellers, showcased in Figure 11.7, demonstrate that the first stage impeller in a multistage setup always possesses the widest flow passage, making it the highest stressed impeller in most cases. The exception lies in refrigeration compressors with side loads. Vendors of dynamic compressors leverage specific speed to select impellers based on provided process data. The total head required and inlet volume flow are pivotal inputs for the vendor's calculations to determine the number of compressor impellers needed, balancing mechanical limitations and performance expectations.\n\nFurthermore, the optimal compressor speed for the highest overall efficiency is determined by specific speed, as illustrated in Figure 11.8. A higher specific speed typically correlates with increased efficiency. However, it is crucial to prioritize mechanical design aspects such as impeller stress and rotor stability before finalizing impeller selection to maintain compressor reliability.\n\nIn summary, understanding the relationship between impeller design, specific speed, and efficiency is essential in ensuring optimal compressor performance and reliability, balancing the quest for efficiency gains with mechanical design integrity."

Mechanical losses encompass bearing, seal, and windage losses. For estimating, a typical value for mechanical losses is around 150 H.P.\n\nUnderstanding efficiency is key to optimizing compressor design. Surge and stonewall phenomena, such as flow reversals and rapid pressure fluctuations, are critical aspects affecting compressor performance. Surge, a high-speed occurrence, can lead to mechanical damage and noise generation. Surge intensity varies based on fluid properties, with higher pressure applications posing greater risks. Surge often results from low velocity in blade passages, causing flow disruptions.\n\nFlow discontinuities, like backflows in impeller passages, limit energy production. These disruptions hinder the transfer of energy from the impeller to the gas. The gas exit angle plays a significant role in energy transfer efficiency.

The intensity of surge varies across applications, with higher density fluids posing a greater risk of mechanical harm. Low-density applications, such as hydrogen, can induce surge damage only detectable upon equipment disassembly.\n\nSurge results from low velocities in impeller passages, whereby a reduction in flow through the vanes triggers a shift from laminar to turbulent flow, causing discontinuities. This can lead to flow back into the impeller, limiting energy production. The repercussions of surge include the gas acting on the impeller instead of vice versa, leading to flow reversals back towards the compressor suction. This can result in pressure reduction, temperature spikes, and potential mechanical issues within the compressor.\n\nSurge avoidance is crucial, particularly in axial compressors susceptible to rapid temperature escalation. Moreover, high flow limits, known as choke or stonewall, define the maximum flow an impeller can handle before acting as a resistance.

The effects of surge, including noise generation, mechanical damage, and the potential for the unit to trip, can be severe. Of these effects, rapid temperature increase is particularly damaging as it can result in internal rubs, impeller and diaphragm breakage, and other significant mechanical issues.\n\nThe operation range of a compressor is crucial, with surge range typically between 60% to 80% of design flow and carryout range between 110% to 130% of design flow. If surge is not addressed promptly, it can render the compressor inoperable for extended periods, causing substantial revenue losses.

Centrifugal pumps also experience similar flow separation phenomena at low flows, sometimes leading to cavitation due to vaporization caused by recirculation. Stall occurs when the flow reduces to a point causing flow separation, demanding more head in any dynamic compressor. Flow instability at surge flow leads to a reduction in head produced by the impeller, resulting in a surge (stall) state.\n\nStall can be triggered by flow separation at any point within a compressor stage, decreasing the head impeller regardless of the separation location. The dynamic compressor performance curve decreases to the left of the surge line due to flow separation's increased losses and reduced head production. Backflow from flow separation in the compressor stage causes a decrease in head produced, resulting in a surge cycle where the compressor operates in the high flow region. Surge cycle continues until either the head produced by the compressor increases or the head required by the process reduces.\n\nTo eliminate surge rapidly, reducing discharge pressure is essential by opening a blow-off or recycle valve. Stonewall or choke flow occurs when the impeller reaches its maximum flow handling capacity, where excessive relative gas velocity through the impeller causes a sudden drop in the compressor curve. The limit of high volume flow in a compressor is governed by the relative mach number, which signifies the maximum possible flow by any dynamic compressor when it equals 1."

Surge can be rapidly eliminated by reducing the discharge pressure using a blow-off or recycle valve. The damaging effects of surge and the definition of stonewall or choke flow are integral to understanding compressor behavior.\n\nStonewall, characterized by excessive gas velocity through the impeller, is the maximum flow an impeller can handle when the ratio of relative gas velocity to the sonic velocity reaches 1.0. The limit of high volume flow in compressors is governed by the relative mach number. Gases with high molecular weight reach stonewall sooner than those with low molecular weight due to sonic velocity characteristics. Stonewall is non-destructive; however, dynamic compressor tests are carried out in stonewall to reduce load horsepower.

Conversely, holding molecular weight constant while changing temperature leads to a decrease in pressure ratio. Impeller design is affected by gas composition changes, influencing head generation. Factors like impeller tip speed, exit gas velocity, volume flow rate variations, and gas velocity at the exit impact head slightly.

These topics will be discussed in detail later in the book. The function of the turbo-compressor casing is defined in Figure 14.3. Casings can be either horizontally or vertically (barrel type) split. The major problem connected with casing design is distortion caused by excessive piping or foundation forces. During construction or whenever piping is removed from the casing, movement of more than 0.002 inch (0.05mm) should require correction. Soft foot caused by the foundation is checked externally. The function of compressor inlet guide vanes is defined in Figure 14.4. Adjustable guide vanes alter the dynamic compressor performance curve by changing the gas velocity vector with the blades.

The function of compressor inlet guide vanes is to direct and distribute the gas to each impeller. Centrifugal compressor guide vanes are fixed, while axial compressor guide vanes can be adjustable during operation. Adjustable guide vanes alter the dynamic compressor performance curve by changing the gas velocity vector with the blades, impacting the gas tangential velocity and energy production.\n\nAdjustable guide vanes must be set correctly to avoid operational issues. Components of a dynamic compressor rotor include axial and centrifugal impellers. Centrifugal impellers handle flows ranging from 100 to over 100,000 CFM, while axial impellers are used above 100,000 CFM. The rotor, consisting of the shaft, impellers, thrust disc, and balance drum, rotates to increase energy production.\n\nCommon rotor issues include component and rotor unbalance, excessive stress on blades, and natural frequency problems. Diaphragms can be made of cast iron or cast steel and are vital in turbine operation. Diffusers play a crucial role in increasing stage head production. Modifications like the cabbage cutter wheel have proved successful in addressing impeller side plate fatigue issues.\n\nInter-stage seals, made of aluminum or alternative materials, minimize leakage and vibration. Abradable seals, originating from the aircraft industry, improve efficiency by eliminating rotor excitation.

Its main functions involve converting velocity into pressure, guiding gas flow effectively, and preventing leakages from the impeller discharge. Specifically, the implementation of low solidity diffusers (L.S.D.) has proven beneficial, as they mitigate pressure fluctuations by moving the vanes up the diffuser.\n\nInter-stage seals play a crucial role in minimizing leakage between the diffuser and the impeller inlet, as well as between different stages of the compressor. Different seal materials, such as abradable materials like fluorisint and honeycomb arrangements of hastelloy, have been utilized to improve efficiency. However, it is essential to ensure pressure balance in the labyrinth seals to prevent premature wear and maintain performance levels. Abradable seals have shown significant advantages in efficiency improvements, with temperature limitations varying for different materials.\n\nMoreover, shaft end seals are vital for containing process fluid within the compressor, directing any leakages to safe outlets. These seals are predominantly designed as double seals, with a sealing fluid supplied at a higher pressure than the process fluid to maintain containment effectiveness. Special attention is given to labyrinth seal wear, with causes including rotor vibration, excessive moisture, and fouling. It is recommended to monitor compressor performance and efficiency closely, especially in the presence of identified causes of seal wear.\n\nIn summary, the successful operation of a compressor relies heavily on the effectiveness of its seals, with specific considerations for materials, pressure balancing, and maintenance to ensure optimal performance and longevity."

Turbo-compressor mechanical design overview includes the function of journal bearings supporting the rotor with an oil film. Thrust bearings position the rotor axially in the casing and handle the loads generated by the blades and balance drum. The thrust bearing supports all compressor axial loads, and a typical hydrodynamic double-acting thrust bearing can withstand pressures up to 500 psi. Most industry specifications limit the load pressure to around 250 psi.\n\nIn some cases, a thrust balancing system is necessary to lower the thrust load on the bearings. This system reduces thrust by counteracting the impeller thrust force and lowering the thrust bearing load. The balance drum and seal increase the bearing load pressure at low loads but are designed to reduce thrust at maximum loads. Monitoring balance drum condition is crucial for preventing thrust bearing failures caused by balance seal wear. The balance line maintains the balance chamber pressure and serves as an effective method for condition monitoring."

        "Part 62": "The approximate pressure that would cause a bearing failure is 500 psi, with industry specifications typically limiting the load pressure to around 250 psi. However, there are exceptions to this rule, particularly for gearboxes and compressors with integral gearboxes, which may have design loads in the range of 300-400 psi due to torque being a significant source of bearing load in gearboxes. Design considerations must encompass the entire torque range, from start-up conditions with low torque to maximum conditions. At start-up, the load pressure on the bearings is relatively small, resulting in many gears being unstable or vibrating at low loads. To address this, a Turbo-compressor mechanical design overview focuses on balancing thrust loads through a balance chamber referenced to pressure parameters. By maintaining design clearance between the balance drum and seal, thrust on the bearings is reduced, albeit with a trade-off of increased load pressure at low loads.\n\nIn scenarios where it is not feasible to maintain the load pressure at 250 psi due to inadequate bearing area, a thrust balancing system is necessary to alleviate the thrust load. This system works by providing a counteracting force to the impeller thrust, thus reducing the thrust bearing load. The balance drum is designed to offer sufficient area to generate the desired force across it, with the balance force calculation based on differential pressure and the balance drum's area. Monitoring balance drum conditions, particularly balance line pressure, is crucial for detecting potential thrust bearing failures caused by balance seal wear.\n\nVarious configurations of thrust balancing systems in compressors impact thrust load changes with flow variations. Each custom-designed compressor presents a unique thrust vs. flow curve based on its balancing system design. Lubrication systems play a vital role in providing continuous lubrication to bearings, ensuring proper pressure and flow rate to mitigate frictional heat. Different types of radial bearings, including anti-friction and hydrodynamic bearings, are discussed, with a focus on the latter due to their predominant usage in turbo-compressor operations for equipment above 500 horsepower. Hydrodynamic bearings rely on a liquid film, typically lubricating oil, to support equipment loads and minimize friction.

In situations involving Principles of Rotating Equipment gears, the radial load mainly comprises the meshing force of the gear teeth, which can vary from zero to maximum torque. It is crucial to ensure proper bearing design to accommodate these variable load angles effectively.\n\nThis section delves into the examination of loads on hydrodynamic bearings, offering an example of bearing sizing based on both static and dynamic loads within a rotor system. Specific oil film pressure limits dictate the dimensions of the bearings, encompassing length and diameter. The text also delves into various types of hydrodynamic bearings, including plain, stationary anti-whirl types, and tilt pads. Condition monitoring requirements for radial bearings are discussed along with shaft vibration and its troubleshooting aspects.\n\nAnti-friction bearings, on the other hand, support the rotor through rolling elements to diminish friction losses. Typically utilized in applications below 500 H.P., as well as in aero-derivative gas turbines, they require sufficient bearing area to support all forces acting on the bearing. Design considerations and calculations, like the Hertzian stress on the bearing elements and rings, are integral to proper design. The text further elaborates on D-N number definition and uses, along with lubrication requirements based on bearing types.\n\nThe document touches on the operational limits and lifespan aspects of anti-friction bearings, highlighting the 'B-10' or 'L-10' life specifications. The bearing life's dependence on bearing loads is emphasized, noting that even slight variations in loads can significantly impact the bearing's longevity. Investigations are recommended should anti-friction bearings encounter sudden failures, with potential causes such as increased bearing loads from various sources like piping forces, foundation forces, misalignment, or unbalance.\n\nHydrodynamic bearings, in contrast, rely on a liquid wedge created by the shaft's motion to support the rotor. Oil supply pressure values typically range around 15-20 psig, with the shaft acting akin to a pump to boost support pressure and establish the wedge. The bearing's support liquid pressure is influenced by the projected bearing area, determined by the bearing's axial length and diameter. Practices in compressor applications often cap hydrodynamic bearing loads at around 250 psi for optimal performance."

Oil is introduced into the bearing at pressure levels typically ranging from 15-20 psig. The shaft acts as a pump, elevating the support pressure to establish the wedge. The support liquid's pressure, often mineral oil, is determined by the bearing area through the formula: P = Support pressure (P.S.I.) F = Total bearing loads (static and dynamic) A = Projected bearing area (Aprojected = L X d) In a radial bearing design, for instance, a 4'' diameter bearing with a 2'' axial length would result in Aprojected = 8 in2. In the case where the total forces on the bearing amount to 1600 pounds force, the wedge's pressure is determined as P = 1600 pounds force. The design ideally aims for around 500 psi support, yet for compressor applications, limiting hydrodynamic bearing loads to approximately 250 psi is common practice. The main force is the vertical load for horizontal bearings, although the tangential fluid force becomes significant at high shaft speeds. The bearing load vector is a combination of the load force and the fluid's tangential force. The fluid's radial force counters the load vector, providing support to the shaft. Research shows that oil flow velocity averages about 47-52% of the shaft velocity. The fluid tangential force is directly related to the oil flow velocity. If this force surpasses the load force, the shaft may become unstable, leading to oil whirl. Regardless of the hydrodynamic bearing type, all bearing surfaces are coated with a material called Babbitt, consisting of tin and lead. Babbitt, with a melting point over 400°F, deforms at around 320°F under load. Various modifications exist to boost the load capacity of hydrodynamic bearings, including copper-backed Babbitt, back pad cooling, and direct cooling to targeted load points. Different types of hydrodynamic journal bearings, like straight sleeve bearings, are tailored to suit specific speed ranges or applications, with the inclusion of measures such as pressure dams to enhance stability. Tilt pad journal bearings are popular for high-speed applications, offering increased contact area due to their pad conforming to the shaft's orbit, as well as effective prevention against oil whirl. These bearings are commonly specified for turbo-compressor applications for their reliability and performance."

Straight sleeve bearings are preferred for low shaft speeds (less than 5,000 RPM) or older turbo-compressor designs, often modified with a pressure dam in the top half of the bearing to enhance load vector. Assembling the pressure dam in the lower half would lead to bearing instability. For higher speeds, tilt pad journal bearings, as depicted in Figure 15.8, are commonly utilized. These bearings offer increased contact area as pads conform to shaft orbit, effectively preventing oil whirl.\n\nCondition monitoring of hydrodynamic journal bearings is crucial, involving monitoring parameters like radial vibration, bearing pad temperature, shaft position, lube oil supply/drain temperature, viscosity, flash point, and particle size. Figure 15.10 illustrates these condition parameters along with their typical limits, emphasizing the importance of tracking shaft position changes indicative of alterations in bearing forces or surface wear. Reliable condition monitoring necessitates establishing baseline conditions, recording trends, and defining condition limits per parameter for effective maintenance planning.\n\nMoreover, the trend data presented in Figure 15.12 indicates the need for bearing inspection during the upcoming scheduled shutdown due to increased shaft position, vibration, and bearing pad temperature observed in month 6. Vibration instabilities play a significant role in diagnosing journal bearing issues by providing valuable diagnostic insights into potential problems. Excitation forces, as explained in Figure 15.13 and outlined with examples in Figure 15.14, can lead to forced vibrations affecting rotor (shaft) dynamics.

Vibration instabilities associated with journal bearings provide diagnostic information valuable in determining the root cause of a problem. Forced vibrations, lateral and axial transient vibrations, and torsional and axial vibrations are key components influencing rotor (shaft) vibration. Turbo-compressors typically monitor shaft vibration using a non-contact proximity probe system to measure the peak-to-peak unfiltered shaft vibration relative to the bearing bracket. Vibration severity chart recommends setting alarm and trip levels based on various parameters. Shaft vibration levels should consider application characteristics, rotor response, mode shapes, and potential revenue loss. Filtering vibration data is crucial in diagnosing vibration-related issues effectively. The root cause of vibration can be determined by analyzing filtered vibration data.

A thrust force is also exerted in the axial direction due to the pressure differential between the equipment atmospheric suction pressure and the atmospheric pressure. An example of a specific rotor thrust case will be covered in this section. Calculating thrust balance will be demonstrated, highlighting the importance of employing an axial force balance device known as a balance drum in certain applications. The absence of this device can lead to excessive axial bearing loadings in older designs. These designs often incorporate a fixed close clearance bushing made out of babbitt, which melts at around 350°F. If the temperature surpasses this threshold, catastrophic failures can occur within the machine as the effectiveness of the balance drum is lost suddenly.\n\nUnderstanding the function and potential high axial forces without this device is crucial for condition monitoring of turbo-compressors. Various machine configurations, including natural balanced thrust, will be explored to showcase how thrust values change with machine flow rate even in balanced machines. Additionally, thrust system condition monitoring will be discussed, addressing the complexities involved in monitoring these machines.\n\nA typical hydrodynamic double-acting thrust bearing assembly comprises a thrust collar mounted on the rotor and two sets of thrust pads, usually supported by a base ring. The thrust bearing assembly functions to continuously support all axial loads and maintain the axial position of the rotor. The thrust pads are designed to provide sufficient thrust area to absorb all thrust while preventing the support film pressure limit from being exceeded, which is approximately 500 psi to avoid thrust bearing overload. Thrust pad temperature sensors are strategically placed to prevent steel-to-steel contact and subsequent turbo-compressor damage. Figure 16.4 illustrates the consequences of overload on a tilt-pad self-equalizing thrust bearing pad when the support film pressure limit is breached. This breakdown results in contact between the steel thrust collar and the thrust bearing pad overlay, leading to significant damage."

To achieve these functions, thrust bearings are designed to provide sufficient support area to absorb all axial thrust. However, when the support film pressure limit is exceeded (approximately 500 psi), issues can arise. Evidence of overload on a tilt-pad self-equalizing thrust bearing pad is depicted in Figure 16.4, where the breakdown of the oil film leads to contact between the steel thrust collar and the thrust bearing pad overlay, potentially causing damage to the turbo-compressor.\n\nThrust pad temperature sensors play a crucial role in protecting the compressor by detecting potential steel-to-steel contact before significant damage occurs. These sensors are positioned behind the babbitt at the pad maximum load point, tripping the unit when necessary. Furthermore, the relationship between thrust pad temperature, thrust load, and bearing size and speed is illustrated in Figures 16.5 and 16.6, indicating the importance of monitoring these parameters for optimal performance.\n\nApart from supporting axial loads, thrust bearings also work to maintain the axial position of the rotor. This function is carried out by placing stainless steel shims between the thrust bearing assembly and compressor axial bearing support plates, with the typical thrust assembly clearance ranging between 0.011 to 0.014, subject to variations based on thrust bearing size.\n\nEnsuring the proper positioning of the rotor in the axial direction is critical for overall efficiency and to prevent axial rubs during transient operation conditions. Additionally, impeller thrust forces generated by compressor blades or impellers contribute to the axial force towards the suction side. These forces need to be carefully balanced to optimize compressor performance and prevent excessive loads on thrust bearings."

The axial force towards the compressor suction is influenced by factors such as flow rate, speed, and gas composition. Balancing these forces is essential to prevent excessive axial loads on the rotor and thrust bearings.\n\nFigure 16.8 illustrates how a balance drum or opposed impeller design can effectively reduce thrust forces. By adjusting the balance drum face area, opposing forces can be generated to counteract impeller thrust, thus minimizing thrust bearing loads. The effectiveness of the balance drum is contingent on a well-functioning seal to prevent thrust bearing failures.\n\nIt is important to note that a balance drum is only employed when the thrust bearing's capacity is insufficient to handle the total compressor axial load. The balance drum system's effectiveness is directly tied to the seal's integrity. An improperly sealed balance drum can lead to thrust bearing failures. Contrary to common belief, a balance drum may not always reduce rotor thrust to zero, and its impact varies depending on the system design and operating conditions.\n\nRegarding thrust balance systems, the active thrust direction is not always towards the compressor suction and can change based on the design configuration. Active thrust assumptions should be avoided where possible to accurately determine the direction of axial displacements. Monitoring rotor position, thrust pad temperature, and balance line pressure are vital for detecting thrust bearing issues early and ensuring turbo-compressor reliability.\n\nCondition monitoring and trending of critical parameters like rotor position are crucial for diagnosing thrust bearing failures and preventing potential damage to turbo-compressors.

Thrust condition monitoring Failure of a thrust bearing can cause term and possibly catastrophic damage to a turbo-compressor. Condition monitoring and trending of critical thrust bearing parameters will optimize turbo-compressor reliability. The critical thrust bearing condition monitoring parameters are: Rotor position, Thrust pad temperature, Balance line AP. Rotor position is the most common thrust bearing condition parameter and provides useful information regarding the direction of thrust. It also provides an indication of thrust load but does not confirm that thrust load is high. All axial displacement monitors have pre-set (adjustable) values for alarm and trip in both thrust directions. Typically, the established procedure is to record the thrust clearance (shims installed) during shutdown and set the alarm and trip settings as follows: Alarm = Clearance + 10 mils (each direction) Trip = Alarm Setting + 5 mils (each direction). The above procedure assumes the rotor is in the mid or zero position of the thrust clearance. It is strongly recommended that any alarm or trip displacement value be confirmed by thrust pad temperature if possible prior to taking action. If an axial displacement alarm or trip signal is activated, observe the corresponding thrust pad temperature. If it is below 220°F, take the following action: Observe thrust pads. If no evidence of high load is observed (pad and back of pad) confirm calibration of thrust monitor and change settings if necessary. The last condition monitoring parameter for the thrust system is balance line pressure drop. An increase of balance line AP will indicate increased balance drum seal leakage and will result in higher thrust bearing load. Noting the baseline AP of the balance line and trending this parameter will provide valuable information as to the root cause of a thrust bearing failure. In many field case histories, the end user made many thrust bearing replacements until an excessive balance drum clearance was discovered as the root cause of the thrust bearing failure. It is a good practice to always check the balance line AP after reported machine surge. Surging will cause high internal gas temperatures which can damage the balance drum seal."

It is essential for these streams to be free of gas contamination. \n\nThe fluid entering the gas side bushing is carefully controlled to a minimal volume, which can either be discarded or returned to the reservoir after degassing. Typically, this volume is limited to less than 20 gallons per day per seal. This regulated fluid, in contact with the high-speed shaft, combines with sealing gas and enters the seal leakage system, which comprises an automatic drainer, a vent system, and a degassing tank if provided. \n\nThe automatic drainer collects the oil-gas mixture from the gas side seal, with the liquid level controlled to drain oil back to the reservoir or the degassing tank as needed. The vent system ensures that all gas side seal oil leakage is directed to the drainer by maintaining a lower pressure than that at the gas side seal. The degassing tank, typically heated for effective degassing, allows sufficient residence time to remove all dissolved gases from the seal oil before returning it to the reservoir.\n\nThe major sub-systems of the seal system will now be discussed in detail, focusing on their functions to streamline the overall operation of the system. Referring to the seal oil system definition, it mirrors a lube oil system's function with the key difference lying in the delivery of seal fluid at a specified differential pressure. The differential pressure control in seal systems, unlike in lube systems, references the gas pressure to the seal oil supply pressure for consistent operation. \n\nThe components of the seal oil system are sized similarly to those of a lube oil system, with considerations for heat load and required flow to remove frictional heat under varying conditions. The sizing process involves testing seals at different speeds to determine the necessary flow rates and heat loads. Pumps, exchangers, filters, and control valves are then sized according to these requirements. The sizing of the seal oil reservoir follows the same principles as in a lube oil system. \n\nNotably, the atmospheric bushing flow in a seal system fluctuates with changing differential pressures, distinguishing it from bearing systems. A double seal arrangement is typical in compressor seals, with the gas side seal's differential pressure remaining constant by design, while the atmospheric side seal's differential pressure varies with the process pressure.

Seal Oil Supply Flow in both cases = 15 GPM\n\nCompressor Seal System Overview and Types:\nAs shown in the previous example, the required seal oil supply at maximum operating speed required to remove frictional heat is 15 gallons a minute. At start-up, low suction pressure conditions, the control valve must open to allow an additional ten gallons a minute flow through to the seal chamber. This type of system is less sensitive to low suction pressure operation since flow through oil will remove frictional heat around the atmospheric bushing.\n\nExample 2: Contact type gas side seal - bushing type atmospheric seal with orificed through flow the back pressure:\nThe only difference between this type of system and the previous is maintained constant by a permanently installed through flow orifice. This system is more susceptible to high-temperature atmospheric bushing conditions at low suction pressures and must be observed during such operation to ensure integrity of the atmospheric bushing.\n\nIf continued low pressure operation is anticipated with such a system, consideration should be given to a means of changing the minimum flow and maximum flow orifice for various operation points. Externally piped bypass orifices could be arranged such that a bypass line with a large orifice for minimum suction pressure conditions could be installed and opened during this operation.\n\nIt is essential to properly design the entire supply system for this flow condition and size the control valve adequately to ensure proper flow at this condition. In addition, the low-pressure bypass line must be completely closed during normal high-pressure operation.\n\nExample 3: Bushing gas side seal - bushing atmospheric side seal with no flow through provision:\nThe gas side bushing flow will remain constant regardless of differential. The atmospheric bushing flow will vary according to the seal chamber to atmospheric pressure differential. Therefore, the atmospheric bushing must be designed to pass a minimum flow at minimum pressure conditions that will remove frictional heat and thus prevent overheating and damage to the seal."

These couplings are compact and adaptable to axial shaft growth requirements, making them ideal for diverse applications. Gear mesh units in gear couplings are designed to minimize break-away friction factors.

Each coupling type specifies a maximum tolerance for misalignment and axial position changes. Misalignment tolerance is typically around 1/4°, while axial position change tolerance varies among coupling types. Gear couplings, such as those shown in Figures 19.2 and 19.3, are commonly used and offer advantages in compactness for torque transmission and minimal overhung weight. They can also accommodate axial growth of the shafts effectively.\n\nHowever, gear couplings have a common drawback related to break-away friction in the axial direction due to contact forces between gear teeth. This issue can lead to unpredictable forces on the shafts, potentially impacting the coupling's ability to correct misalignments or handle thermal changes. Manufacturers have implemented strategies to mitigate these effects, such as optimizing gear tooth finish, reducing sludge buildup, and improving lubricant filtration.\n\nDesign considerations for gear couplings also involve assessing the break-away friction factor to determine the axial force required for gear mesh adjustment. Machinery users and designers must account for these factors when selecting couplings and ensuring compatibility with thrust bearings. In cases of misalignment, cyclic axial forces generated during operation can lead to increased vibration levels, necessitating monitoring and appropriate structural considerations for machinery mounting."

It is crucial for adjacent thrust bearings to be capable of withstanding this force along with the machine's normal calculated thrust forces.\n\nMachinery train designers and users should be mindful of this aspect and make provisions for it in the safety factors of thrust bearings and machinery mounting design to avoid potential issues. Excessive misalignment during machinery operation can lead to vibration, as the gear mesh position must adjust with each shaft revolution to rectify misalignment. This adjustment results in cyclic counter axial forces due to the opposite movement directions of the mesh on each side of the coupling.\n\nVibration detection and monitoring tools will indicate that the resultant vibration occurs at twice the running frequency of the shafts. Although the primary force generated is axial, the resulting vibration may manifest as radial due to the lever arm forces required on the coupling spacer to mimic ball and socket connections with the gear meshes.\n\nFlexible membrane or flexible disc couplings belong to a category that does not have moving parts and attain flexibility through controlled flexure of specially designed diaphragms or discs.

Attention is crucial in managing shaft end separation to prevent excessive axial loads on thrust bearings.\n\nFor critical applications with limited axial end float values, a single diaphragm spacer coupling is preferred. Careful handling during disassembly is essential to avoid damage that could compromise the integrity of the coupling. It is common practice to pre-stretch diaphragm couplings to optimize end float utilization and ensure operational safety.\n\nIn instances where large axial end float values are present, multiple convoluted diaphragm spacer couplings are recommended. These couplings provide high axial end float capacity but may have a higher coupling moment compared to gear type couplings, potentially affecting equipment operation. Reduced moment diaphragm couplings are a viable solution to mitigate excessive coupling moments and maintain operational stability.\n\nFurthermore, couplings with elastomer insert flexible drive members are suited for low horsepower general applications, with considerations for wear factors and challenges in maintaining shape and concentricity. Special designs cater to specific needs, such as synchronous motor-driven compressor trains, where torque fluctuations are effectively managed.

The reduced moment coupling approaches the gear coupling in terms of coupling moment value. Couplings with elastomer insert flexible drive members are typically used for low horsepower, general purpose applications. These couplings have limitations concerning wear and maintaining shape and concentricity of the elastomer insert, which can restrict the maximum design speed at which they can operate. One exception is a special design used for synchronous motor-driven compressor trains. Synchronous motors exhibit a variable oscillating torque characteristic that decreases linearly in frequency from 2X line frequency (50 Hz or 60 Hz) at 0 RPM to zero frequency at rated RPM.\n\nWhen the motor's torsional excitation frequency momentarily aligns with a torsional natural frequency, torque values can amplify significantly, reaching up to 5 or 6 times the full load torque. The 'Holset' or elastomeric coupling is designed to reduce torque amplification by damping the response in the elastomeric elements. The hardness of these elements is controlled to limit the maximum amplification factor to an acceptable range, usually 2-3 times the rated torque.

On the other hand, hydraulic fits are used where heat removal of the coupling hub is either unavailable or not permissible. For turbo-compressors, often hydraulic fits are preferred due to the flame-free environment required in the presence of hydrocarbon gas.\n\nDifferent tapers are used for shaft/coupling hub matching, with the most common being 1/2\" per foot taper and 3/4\" per foot taper for shafts larger than 4\" in diameter. The required shrink fit for hydraulic couplings is calculated based on shaft and coupling dimensions, usually expressed as 'drive' or 'push' based on the shaft taper.

It is crucial for maintaining proper foundation forces to prevent bearing overloads and rotor misalignment. Different design features are incorporated into turbine casings to accommodate high operating temperatures, with special considerations for thermal expansion and joint sealing mechanisms.\n\nThrottle valves, both single and multiple, are designed to regulate steam flow with minimal pressure drop to enhance turbine efficiency.

Broken valve seat parts can block the nozzle ring, reducing the first stage pressure to the turbine. All multi-stage turbines are provided with a pressure gauge that monitors the first stage pressure. Noting the baseline first stage pressure, for a given load, and trending this parameter will provide valuable information concerning pressure drop in the throttle valves and steam passages to the first stage of the turbine.\n\nIn single valve turbines, all the steam is admitted to one dedicated set of nozzles. In multi-valve turbines, each valve has a specific passage to a set of nozzles. The arc of admission is defined as the degrees of a circle that the first stage nozzles (or control nozzle) occupy. For single stage turbines, a typical value would be 30°. The nozzle ring, often called the control nozzle, is the only nozzle in a turbine that is not designed for full admission.\n\nThere have been cases where the axial distance between the control stage and the second stage was not sufficient to allow full arc admission of steam to the second stage.

The three types of expansion blading have already been discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of impulse and reaction blading are compared. The different staging alternatives for turbines are described, highlighting designs that impact overall turbine efficiency.\n\nExpansion turbine blading design aims for optimum gas velocity to achieve maximum stage efficiency. Maximum energy extraction from vapor is achieved when the blade tip velocity is a percentage of the vapor velocity. Every turbine vendor has a blade row efficiency curve plotted based on blade tip speed to theoretical steam velocity ratio for each blade row design.

The number of expansion stages required depends on the maximum energy extraction per blade row and theoretical enthalpy considerations. Blade root design must withstand stresses at various speeds, with natural frequency modes influencing blade vibrations. Successful operation hinges on managing steady state, centrifugal, and bending stresses, as well as addressing blade interference through rigorous analysis. The intersection of steady state and alternating stresses must align within safety limits to prevent failure. Despite the reliability of traditional stress analysis methods, failures have occurred due to overlooking blade disc natural frequency effects. Some vendors now integrate these factors for improved performance. Additionally, nozzle functions, including reaction and impulse types, play a crucial role in turbine operation."

The resulting allowable alternating stress must not exceed a known percentage of the maximum allowable value. As long as the intersection of the blade steady state and alternating stresses are within the vendors' limit, continuous operation of the blade will not result in failure. The correlation between predicted Campbell and Goodman values and actual values has been generally good. However, there have been instances where blades predicted to be in a safe operating range have failed.\n\nIt should be noted that the traditional Campbell and Goodman approach does not consider the effect of natural frequency of the blade discs. Some turbine vendors now include these items in their analysis and have reportedly achieved good correlation. The function of nozzles is defined, showing examples of reaction and impulse nozzles. When operating condensing turbines, care must be taken to ensure vendors' maximum allowable moisture percentage is not exceeded in the exhaust blading. Operating for continuous periods can severely erode blading, blade carriers and diaphragms, causing turbine failure.\n\nRegarding shaft end seals, the labyrinth type shaft end seals safely direct the expansion vapor and draw in a buffer gas (air) to prevent expansion vapor contact with the bearings. Functionally, the shaft end seals prevent steam from escaping to the atmosphere along the shaft and entering the bearing housing. Steam turbine shaft sealing systems aim to maintain a slight vacuum in the last chamber of the seal to prevent moisture from entering the bearing bracket and contaminating the oil system. Conditioning monitoring of the system vacuum is essential to ensuring moisture-free lubrication oil.

Single throttle valves, which are not hydraulically actuated, are limited in the available force for valve actuation. Thus, they are balanced and designed for minimal actuation force. However, single throttle valves are inefficient at reduced flow rates, particularly during turbine load, necessitating the use of hand valves to adjust for off-design conditions. In certain cases, hand valves are utilized to maintain the single throttle valve close to full open under varying steam flows.\n\nHand valves in single valve turbines are typically manually actuated and are not modulating but operate in a full open or full closed manner. Throttling a hand valve can result in damage to the valve and valve seat. Moreover, for applications such as generator drives, where full load operation is common, pneumatic or hydraulic operated hand valves open or close as needed by the control system at off-design conditions to enhance turbine efficiency.\n\nOperators must be vigilant regarding the position of hand valves (open or closed) and the power requirements of the turbine to prevent issues like decreased output power and turbine speed due to insufficient steam flow caused by closed hand valves. Preventive maintenance is crucial in single throttle valve systems to reduce friction in linkage bushings, ensuring valve stability and control system response.\n\nIn contrast, multi-valve throttling arrangements are employed when steam flow and power requirements are significant and prone to frequent changes. Such designs allow for more efficient adjustments at off-design conditions to minimize throttling losses. Each valve in a multi-valve system is selected for a specific maximum flow range and is positioned to open in a timed manner to maintain balanced steam flow distribution and avoid rotor vibratory instability.\n\nValve stems in multi-valve systems are adjusted to lift sequentially based on stem length, with the aim of ensuring balanced flow distribution and preventing large forces on the rotor.

These governors utilize a mechanical mechanism to determine output signals, with the output shaft moving a pilot valve that regulates hydraulic fluid to control throttle valves. While mechanical and mechanical-hydraulic governors have been reliable, the need arose for a maintenance-friendly system that led to the introduction of electro/hydraulic governors in the 1970s. These governors do not rely on mechanical input signals, offering precise control, self-diagnostics, and the ability for online maintenance. The shift towards digital governors in the late 1970s brought increased efficiency and the advantage of redundancy to ensure continuous control while one governor undergoes maintenance. The transition to digital governors eliminated the need for significant maintenance, like changing out cards in analog governors. With advancements in microprocessors, digital governors now dominate speed control systems due to their redundancy capability. Redundant and triple redundant governors became popular for seamless control transfer during maintenance, reducing the need for operator intervention. The reliance on distributed control systems in the 1990s for managing processes and machinery functions further signifies the evolution towards automated and centralized control systems in industrial settings.\n"

Dual fuel control systems are also implemented, offering the flexibility of operating on either liquid or gas fuels. In the realm of gas turbine protection systems, features from both steam turbine protection systems and hot gas path over-temperature control are integrated. This includes overspeed protection of each rotor and automatic shutdown triggers for instances such as hot gas path overtemperature, high compressor discharge pressure, external trips, low lube oil pressure, and low control oil pressure. A key focus in this chapter is on the various types and arrangements of lubrication systems used for critical equipment. One prevalent setup involves a shaft-driven positive displacement main pump, supported by a motor-driven auxiliary pump, ensuring continuous lubrication even during coastdown or start-up phases. It is essential to guarantee proper priming of the main pump, especially in cases where the pump is located significantly above the fluid reservoir. Many systems address this by utilizing a priming line from the auxiliary pump to the main pump suction line, which incorporates check valves and self-venting devices to prevent cavitation during start-up. The response of the bypass valve in scenarios where the auxiliary pump fails to shut off post-attainment of full flow from the main pump is critical for maintaining system pressure stability."

        "Part 135": "To ensure continuous lubrication of critical equipment during coastdown or start-up, systems are designed with redundant pumps to prevent oil supply failure. This setup is particularly beneficial in locations lacking alternative energy sources, such as offshore platforms or chemical plants without utility steam systems. The auxiliary pump is configured to initiate before the main equipment, ensuring all bearings are effectively lubricated before the main pump reaches full speed. On shutdown, the auxiliary pump activates upon main pump deceleration. The triggering signal can be based on critical equipment speed or system pressure. Care must be taken to either automatically shut off the auxiliary pump or ensure continuous two-pump operation if automatic shut-off is not incorporated. Additionally, it is advisable to deactivate auxiliary pumps during main pump operation to prevent priming issues. In cases where the main pump is significantly elevated above the fluid reservoir, proper priming measures, such as utilizing a priming line from the auxiliary pump and incorporating a check valve and self-venting device, are essential to prevent cavitation during start-up. Bypass valve response mechanisms are crucial in scenarios where the auxiliary pump fails to shut off after the main pump reaches full flow, ensuring system pressure regulation and preventing equipment shutdown. This setup is particularly critical in facilities without steam systems, like chemical plants or offshore platforms, where continuous pump operation is vital. Emergency pumps, powered by DC sources, are designed to sustain flow during equipment coastdown in cases of power failure, aiming to prevent damage to auxiliary system components. Systems incorporating motor-driven main pumps and steam turbine-driven auxiliary pumps are suitable for plants with dual power sources but limited steam availability. These systems demand strict attention to steam turbine conditions for rapid acceleration and reliable operation."

This emergency pump, activated based on pressure drop within the auxiliary system, is specifically sized to prevent component damage by providing necessary flow during equipment coastdown. In scenarios where dual pump driver power is available but steam usage is to be minimized, such a system is deemed beneficial.\n\nTo maintain optimal performance, it is crucial to ensure that steam is dry, using a steam trap to continuously drain condensate. Rapid turbine acceleration is facilitated by employing a snap open type turbine inlet valve to minimize auxiliary pump start-up time. Alternatively, utilizing a large accumulator in systems with slow steam turbine start-up times can provide adequate flow during the initial stages. \n\nThe text further discusses a dual centrifugal pump system where a steam turbine drives the main pump, and a motor drives the standby pump. This setup is suitable for regions with stable ambient temperatures where a bypass valve is unnecessary due to the flow rate being determined by system resistance for dynamic pumps. Additionally, maintaining similar characteristic curves for the main and auxiliary pumps is essential to ensure their coordinated operation. It is emphasized that in systems with non-identical pumps, the correct adjustment of the turbine governor setting is vital to ensure consistent speeds between the motor and turbine.\n\nFinally, the importance of a rundown tank in lubrication systems is highlighted, providing oil to bearings at lower pressures during emergency shutdowns. Proper sizing and material selection of the tank are emphasized to prevent rust scale or corrosion from causing issues during shutdown. Collaborative efforts between the vendor and user are crucial in determining the appropriate rundown tank size, ensuring sufficient flow for the coastdown period.

The tank will drain when both main and auxiliary pumps cease to function. An important consideration is the material of the rundown tank since it represents a large vessel downstream of the filter in the system. Any rust scale or corrosion present in this tank will go directly into the bearings on shutdown and could cause a significant problem. Rundown tanks should also be sized to provide sufficient flow for the entire coastdown period. The calculation of the equipment coastdown time must include process system information. The lower the system pressure (resistance) during the coastdown period, the longer equipment will continue to turn. A small amount of flow should be continuously circulated through the rundown tank to prevent sediment accumulation and maintain operating viscosity (in cold regions) by installing a return line from the tank to the oil drain line with an orifice to regulate flow.\n\nTwo types of pumps, dynamic and positive displacement, are combined in a system with a centrifugal shaft driven main pump and a motor-driven positive displacement auxiliary pump. It is crucial to limit the maximum pressure of the positive displacement pump below that of the dynamic pump to prevent overheating and failure. The standby pump discharge pressure setting must be less than the dynamic pump's discharge pressure at its minimum flow point. Component accessibility is essential for servicing and calibration of critical equipment lubrication systems, with various arrangement options available such as integral auxiliary systems and horizontal consoles.
